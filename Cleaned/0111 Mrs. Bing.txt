Monica: Why?
Phoebe: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.

Monica: No!
Phoebe: Do it do it do it!
Monica: (Shouts To The Guy) Woo-Woo! (The guy turns round, startled. Monica points to Phoebe. The guy gets hit by a truck)
Phoebe: I Can'T Believe You Did That! Opening Credits [Scene: Hospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting.]
Monica: Why Did I 'Woo-Hoo'? I Mean, What Was I Hoping Would Happen? That-That he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Phoebe: I Just Wish There Was Something We Could Do. (Bends Down And Talks To him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Monica: Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe: Maybe nobody's tried this.
Monica: I Wish We At Least Knew His Name... Look At That Face. I Mean, Even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe: Yeah, But Did You See The Dents In His Knuckles? That Means He'S artistic.
Monica: Okay, He'S A Lawyer, Who Teaches Sculpting On The Side. And- He Can dance!
Phoebe: Oh! And, He'S The Kinda Guy Who, When You'Re Talking, He'S Listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Monica: I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe: I Know. [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Monica And Phoebe Are Telling Everyone About Their Coma guy.]

Rachel: Chandler, I Gotta Tell You, I Love Your Mom'S Books! I Love Her Books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Chandler: Yeah, Well, You Wouldn'T Think It Was Cool If You'Re Eleven Years Old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Ross: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Chandler: You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ross: Oh, Please... (Rachel opens the door to Paolo)
Paolo: Bona sera.
Rachel: Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)
Ross: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?

Phoebe: Hey hey hey! She's on!
Paolo: Ah! Nora Bing!
Jay Leno: (On Tv) ...Now What Is This About You-You Being Arrested I-In London? What is that all about?
Phoebe: Your mom was arrested?
Chandler: Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Mrs. Bing: (On Tv) ...This Is Kind Of Embarrassing, But Occasionally After I'Ve been intimate with a man...
Chandler: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
All: Shhh.
Mrs. Bing: (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Jay Leno: (On Tv) Alright, So Now You'Re Doing This Whole Book Tour Thing, How is that going?
Mrs. Bing: (On Tv) Oh, Fine. I'M Leaving For New York Tomorrow, Which I Hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
All: Awww!
Chandler: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Jay Leno: (On Tv) Y'Know, Don'T Take This Wrong, I-I Just Don'T See You A-As A mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Mrs. Bing: (On Tv) Oh No, I Am A Fabulous Mom! I Bought My Son His First Condoms. (The gang turn to look at Chandler)
Chandler: ...And Then He Burst Into Flames. [Scene: The Hospital, It'S A Montage Of Monica And Phoebe'S Visit To The Hospital With My Guy Playing In The Background. It Starts With Monica Reading A Newspaper To him.]
Monica: Let'S See. Congress Is Debating A New Deficit Reduction Bill... The Mayor Wants To Raise Subway Fares Again... The High Today Was Forty-Five... And- Oh, Teams Played Sports. [Next Is A Shot Of Them Dragging An Enormous Plant Into The Room, Then Monica Knitting a sweater, then Phoebe singing, then Phoebe shaving him and chatting to Monica]

Monica: Nah... not-not special enough.
Phoebe: Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Monica: Waaay Too Special. [Scene: A Mexican Restaurant, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and his mom are there.]
Mrs. Bing: I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)
Chandler: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Mrs. Bing: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Chandler: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Ross: (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Mrs. Bing: Oooh, C'Mon, Shut Up, It'S Fun. Gimme A Hug. (They Both Sit Down) Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Chandler: I know I am.
Mrs. Bing: Who's doing shots?
Monica: Yeah.
Phoebe: I'm in.
Mrs. Bing: There y'go. Ross?
Ross: Uh, I'M Not Really A Shot Drinking Kinda Guy. (Enter Rachel and Paolo. They are both somewhat flustered)
Rachel: Hi! Sorry- Sorry We'Re Late, We, Uh, Kinda Just, Y'Know, Lost Track Of time.
Ross: ...But A Man Can Change. (Downs A Shot) [Time Lapse. Ross Is Now Clearly Drunk. He Is Holding Up A Shot Glass To His Eye Like A jeweller's eye.]
Ross: Anyone Want Me To Appraise Anything? (Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand)
Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I Have To Tell You, I'Ve Read Everything You'Ve Ever Written. No, I Mean It! I Mean, When I Read Euphoria At Midnight, All I Wanted To Do Was Become A writer.
Mrs. Bing: Oh, Please, Honey, Listen, If I Can Do It, Anybody Can. You Just Start With Half A Dozen European Cities, Throw In Thirty Euphemisms For Male Genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.

Ross: Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Mrs. Bing: (To Phone) Okay, Thank You. (To Ross) It'S The Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
Ross: No. It's the one he's licking.
Mrs. Bing: She's supposed to be with you.
Ross: You're good.
Mrs. Bing: Oh, Ross, Listen To Me. I Have Sold A Hundred Million Copies Of My books, and y'know why?
Ross: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Mrs. Bing: No. Because I Know How To Write Men That Women Fall In Love With. Believe Me, I Cannot Sell A Paolo. People Will Not Turn Three Hundred Twenty-Five Pages For A Paolo. C'Mon, The Guy'S A Secondary Character, A, Y'Know, Complication You eventually kill off.

Monica: (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Phoebe: (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
Rachel: Hey.
Phoebe: Hello.
Monica: Hello. 
Phoebe: Going to the hospital tonight?
Monica: No, you?
Phoebe: No, you?
Monica: You just asked me.
Phoebe: Okay, Maybe It Was A Trick Question. (Plays A Few Chords) Um, Rachel Can we do this now?
Rachel: Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
Joey: (To Ross, On The Couch) Now, Here'S A Picture Of My Mother And Father On their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.

Ross: Chandler, Can I Just Say Something? I-I Know You'Re Still Mad At Me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Chandler: Yes, Well, I Expect This From Her. Okay? She'S Always Been A Freudian nightmare. 
Ross: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Chandler: Because It'S Complicated, It'S Complex- Hey, You Kissed My Mom! (People turn to look)
Ross: (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Chandler: That's very funny. We done now?
Ross: No! Okay, You Mean, You'Re Not Gonna Talk To Her, You'Re Not Gonna Tell her how you feel?
Chandler: That Would Be No. Look, Just Because You Played Tonsil Tennis With My mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Ross: Okay, 'You' Can'T, Or (Points To Chandler) You Can'T? (Chandler Grabs His Finger) Okay, That'S My Finger. (Chandler Twists It And Ross Goes Down On One Knee) That'S, That'S My Knee. (To Central Perk) Still Doing The Play. Aaah! [Scene: The Coma Guy'S Room, Monica Bursts In, Closely Followed By Phoebe. There Is No sign of Coma Guy. His bed is empty.]
Phoebe: Alright, Whadyou Do With Him? (There is the sound of a flushing toilet and Coma Guy emerges from the bathroom)

Coma Guy: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Monica: You look good!
Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?
Monica: Oh, sorry.
Phoebe: I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Monica: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Phoebe: Well, we both have.
Coma Guy: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Phoebe: Well, actually it's just from me.
Monica: I got you the foot massager.
Phoebe: You know who shaved you? That was me.
Monica: I read to you.
Phoebe: I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
Coma Guy: Well,... thanks.
Monica: Oh, my pleasure.
Phoebe: You're welcome.
Coma Guy: So. I guess I'll see you around.
Phoebe: What, that's it? 
Monica: "See you around?"
Coma Guy: Well, what do you want me to say?
Monica: Oh, I Don'T Know. Maybe, Um, "That Was Nice?" Admit Something to me? "I'll call you?" 
Coma Guy: Alright, I'll call you.
Phoebe: I don't think you mean that.
Monica: This Is So Typical. Y'Know, We Give, And We Give, And We Give. And Then- We Just Get Nothing Back! And Then One Day, Y'Know, It'S Just, You Wake Up, And "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Y'Know What? We Thought You Were Different. But I Guess It Was Just The Coma. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's Chandler is talking with his mom.]
Mrs. Bing: Car'S Waiting Downstairs, I Just Wanted To Drop Off These Copies Of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Chandler: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Mrs. Bing: Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)
Chandler: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Mrs. Bing: (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Chandler: Really stupid.
Mrs. Bing: Really Stupid. And I Don'T Even Know How It Happened. I'M Sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Chandler: Yeah. No. No... [Cut To The Hallway, Joey Is Listening To Chandler And His Mom'S Conversation Through the door as Ross walks up.]
Ross: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Joey: Shh. He Did It. He Told Her Off, And Not Just About The Kiss, About everything.
Ross: You're kidding.
Joey: No, No. He Said "When Are You Gonna Grow Up And Start Being A mom?"
Ross: Wow!
Joey: Then She Came Back With "The Question Is, When Are You Gonna Grow Up and realise I have a bomb?"
Ross: 'Kay, Wait A Minute, Are You Sure She Didn'T Say "When Are You Gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Joey: That makes more sense.
Ross: So, what's going on now?
Joey: I Dunno, I'Ve Been Standing Here Spelling It Out For You! (Goes Back To the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
Ross: Whaddya see?
Joey: Hard To Tell, They'Re So Tiny And Upside-Down. Wait, Wait. They'Re Walking Away... They'Re Walking Away... No, No They'Re Not, They'Re Coming Right At Us! Run! Run! (Joey Runs Off Down The Hall. Ross Tries Monica And Rachel'S Apartment, But It Is Locked So He Has To Stand In The Hall And Pretend He Wasn'T Listening. Chandler And His mom come out)
Mrs. Bing: You okay, kiddo?
Chandler: Yeah, okay.
Mrs. Bing: Alright. (Kisses him)
Chandler: Nice Save. (She walks down the hall)
Ross: (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
Mrs. Bing: Mr. Geller. (She Leaves) (Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel's door)
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: You mean that?
Chandler: Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
Ross: Yeah? How'd it go?
Chandler: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
Ross: Well, howdya feel?
Chandler: Pretty good! I told her.
Ross: Well, See? So, Maybe It Wasn'T Such A Bad Idea, Y'Know, Me Kissing Your Mom, Uh? Huh? (Wags His Finger At Chandler, Then Puts It Down) But.. We Don'T Have To Go Down That Road. Closing Credits [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is handing out copies of her book to the gang.]
Rachel: Okay. Now This Is Just The First Chapter, And I Want Your Absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Monica: What's a 'niffle'?
Joey: You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Rachel: Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Ross: Wait, Did You Get To The Part About His 'Huge Throbbing Pens'? Tell Ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Rachel: Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
All: Nooo!
