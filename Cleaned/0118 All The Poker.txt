Ross: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Girls: No.
Rachel: But you could teach us.
Guys: No. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.]
Chandler: (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.

Ross: Look, Rachel, This Is Poker. I Play To Win, Alright? In Order For Me To Win, Other People Have To Lose. So If You'Re Gonna Play Poker With Me, Don'T Expect Me To be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
Joey: (pause)...Yeah?
Ross: I'M Not A Nice Guy. [Scene: Ross' apartment. Chandler and Joey are there. Ross enters with a pizza.]
Ross: Alright boys, let's eat.
Chandler: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Ross: You still on that?
Chandler: Oh, Come On. What Was With That Whole Black Bart Speech? (Mimicking): "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"

Rachel: Well, I Just Lost A Job, And I'D Like To Raise The Bet Five Bucks. Does Anybody Have A Problem With That? (Everyone says no and folds, except for Ross, who thinks about it.)
Rachel: (To Ross): Loser? (Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe back their chairs away from the table.)
Ross: No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
Rachel: What Do You Mean, You Fold? Hey, Come On! What Is This? I Thought That 'Once The Cards Were Dealt, I'M Not A Nice Guy.' I Mean, What, Were You Just Full Of It? (Ross thinks it over, finally sits down and picks up his cards.)

Ross: You Got Me. (Monica And Phoebe Get Up And Start Celebrating In The Kitchen, Pouring Wine And singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)
Joey: (to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Chandler: (to Ross): I thought we had them!
Ross: Oh, Well, When You Don'T Have The Cards, You Don'T Have The Cards, You Know. (Looks At Rachel) But, Uh... Look How Happy She Is. (Smiles) (Chandler And Joey Look At Her, And Then Look Back At Him. They Dive For Ross'S Hand To See What He Had, And He Tries To Stop Them From Looking.)
