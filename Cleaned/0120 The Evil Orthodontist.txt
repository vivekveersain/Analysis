 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.]
Chandler: I Can'T Believe You Would Actually Say That. I Would Much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
Joey: No Way! Mr.Salty Is A Sailor, All Right, He'S Got To Be, Like, Thetoughest snack there is.
Ross: I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Monica: (Looking Out Of The Window) Oh My God. You Guys! You Gotta Come See this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Ross: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Rachel: Oh, that is so sick.
Chandler: I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Phoebe: How Can People Do That?... (All But Phoebe Walk Away From The Window In Disgust.) Oh, You Guys, Look! Ugly Naked Guy Got Gravity Boots! Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
Chandler: I Am Telling You, Years From Now, Schoolchildren Will Study It As One Of The Greatest First Dates Of All Time. It Was Unbelievable! We Could Totally Be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Monica: So have you called her yet?
Chandler: Let Her Know I Like Her? What Are You, Insane? (The Girls Make Disgusted Noises.) It'S The Next Day! How Needy Do I Want To Seem? (To The Guys) I'M right, right?
Joey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Monica: I Can'T Believe My Parents Are Actually Pressuring Me To Find One Of You people.
Phoebe: Oh, God, Just Do It! (Grabbing The Phone.) Call Her! Stop Being So testosteroney!
Chandler: Which, By The Way, Is The Real San Francisco Treat. (Calls Her, Then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
Joey: Her answer machine?
Chandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Phoebe: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Chandler: Oh, No-No-No-No. Last Time I Left A Spontaneous Message I Ended Up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?
Phoebe: Okay, they're just talking...
Ross: Yeah, Well, Does He Look Upset? Does He Look Like He Was Just Told To shove anything?
Phoebe: No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Ross: What? What? What?!
Phoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
Chandler: (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
All: Oh!... Right!
Chandler: Hey Rach!
Monica: How'd it go?
Rachel: Y'Know, It Was, Uh.. It Was Actually Really Great. He Took Me To Lunch At The Russian Tea Room, And I Had That Chicken, Where Y'Know You Poke It And All the butter squirts out...
Phoebe: Not a good day for birds...
Rachel: Then We Took A Walk Down To Bendall'S, And I Told Him Not To, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Ross: That'S Nice... Now, Was That Before Or After You Told Him To Stop Calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Rachel: Right,.. Well,.. We Never Actually Got To That... Oh, It Was Just So nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Ross: That's, that's nice twice!
Monica: Rachel, What'S Going On? I Mean Isn'T This The Same Barry Who You Left at the altar?
Joey: Duh, where've you been?
Rachel: Yeah, But It Was Different With Him Today! And He Wasn'T, Like, Orthodontist Guy, Y'Know? I Mean, We Had Fun! Is There Anything Wrong With That? (Ross 'prompts' Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)
Chandler: Yes!
Rachel: Why?
Chandler: I have my reasons.
Monica: Okay, How About The Fact That He'S Engaged To Another Woman, Who Just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Rachel: All Right. All Right, All Right, All Right, All Right, I Know It'S Stupid! I Will Go See Him This Afternoon, And I Will Just Put An End To It! [Scene: Barry's Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.]
Rachel: Wow... Wow!
Barry: Yeah.
Rachel: I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Barry: Nooo, it wasn't.
Rachel: Ooh, And It'S So Nice Having This Little Sink Here... [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.]
Chandler: (On Phone, Reading From A Script) Oh, Danielle! I Wasn'T Expecting The Machine... Give Me A Call When You Get A Chance. (Rattles Some Dishes) Bye-Bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
Monica: That'S What You'Ve Been Working On For The Past Two hours?!
Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!
Ross: What was with the dishes?
Chandler: Oh, Uh.. I Want Her To Think I Might Be In A Restaurant.. Y'Know? I Might Have Some Kind Of Life, Like I Haven'T Been Sitting Around Here Honing For The Past few hours.
Monica: (Looking Out The Window) Look Look! He'S Doing It Again, The Guy With the telescope!
Phoebe: Oh My God! (Walks To The Window) Go Away! (Gesturing.) Stop Looking In here!
Monica: Great, now he's waving back.
Joey: Man, We Gotta Do Something About That Guy. This Morning, I Caught Him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Monica: What kinda stuff?
Joey: Will You Grow Up? I'M Not Talking About Sexy Stuff, But, Like, When I'M cooking naked.
Phoebe: You cook naked?
Joey: Yeah, Toast, Oatmeal... Nothing That Spatters. (A pause as they look at Chandler.)
Chandler: What Are You Looking At Me For? I Didn'T Know That. [Scene: Barry's Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.]
Barry: What's the matter?
Rachel: Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Barry: No, it was. It was very very good.
Rachel: Well, what about Mindy?
Barry: Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
Rachel: No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Barry: Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Rachel: No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. 
Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Barry: (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.
Rachel: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Barry: We Can, We Can Go To Aruba! When I Went There On What Would Have Been Our Honeymoon, It Was, Uh... It Was Really Nice. You Would'Ve Liked It. (Pause as Rachel realises...)
Rachel: I Had A Bra. (Barry Finds It Draped On A Cupboard And Gives It To Rachel, They Kiss As Bobby enters.)
Bobby: Hey, Dr. Farber. (Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.)
Barry: All Right Miss Green, Everything Looks Fine... Yep, I Think We'Re Starting To See Some Real Progress Here. (Bobby looks on, deadpan.)
Rachel: What?!
Bobby: I'M Twelve, I'M Not Stupid. (Rachel Glares At Him.) [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters clutching his phone.]
Chandler: Can I use your phone?
Monica: Yeah.. Uh, But For Future Reference, That Thing In Your Hand Can Also Be Used As A Phone. (Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)
Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Joey: Maybe she never got your message.
Phoebe: Y'Know, If You Want, You Can Call Her Machine, And If She Has A Lot Of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Chandler: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ross: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Chandler: Ah, You Obviously Saw My Personal Ad. (He calls and quickly hangs up.)
Phoebe: How many beeps?
Chandler: She answered.
Monica: Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Chandler: I'M Not Gonna Talk To Her, She Obviously Got My Message And Is Choosing Not To Call Me. Now I'M Needy And Snubbed. God, I Miss Just Being Needy. (Rachel enters.)
All: Hey! Hi!
Phoebe: How'd he take it?
Rachel: Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)
Monica: (Wandering In After Her) Uh, Rach... How Come You Have Dental Floss In your hair?
Rachel: Oh, do I?
Monica: Uh huh.
Rachel: (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
Monica: You Had Sex In His Chair?!... I Said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Ross: You-you had what?
Phoebe: Sex in his chair.
Ross: What, uh... what were you thinking?
Rachel: I Don'T Know! I Mean, We Still Care About Each Other. There'S A History there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Rachel: Please. If She Said To You, "Ross, I Want You On This Couch, Right Here, Right Now," What Would You Say?  (Ross flounders.)
Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over.
Ross: It'S, It'S, It'S, Uh, A Totally Diferent Situation! It'S, It'S Apples And oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Phoebe: Where are you going?
Ross: (Leaving) I Just Have To Go, All Right? Do I Need A Reason? Huh? I Mean I Have Things To Do With My Life, I Have A Jam Packed Schedule, And I Am Late- For Keeping Up With It. Okay? (Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)
Chandler: Hello? Hello? (Rachel Picks Up Their Phone And The Ringing Stops. As She Talks On The Phone, An elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)

Mindy: Now, I Know Things'Ve Been Weird Lately, But You'Re Like My Oldest Friend In The World... Except For Maybe Laurie Schaffer, Who I Don'T Talk To Anywhere, 'Cause She'S All Bitter Now That She Lost The Weight And It Turns Out She Doesn'T Have A Pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.

Rachel: Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
Mindy: That's not all.
Rachel: Oh sure it is!
Mindy: Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Rachel: Um, what- what would make you think that?
Mindy: Well, Ever Since We Announced The Engagement, He'S Been Acting Really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Rachel: (Draws Back) Really. Mindy, If It'Ll Make You Feel Any Better, When I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Mindy: Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Rachel: What? What's what you were afraid of?
Mindy: Okay, Okay... When Barry Was Engaged To You, He And I...Kind Of... Had A little thing on the side.
Rachel: What?
Mindy: I Know. I Know, And When He Proposed To Me, Everyone Said "Don'T Do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Rachel: Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Mindy: What do you mean?
Rachel: (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
