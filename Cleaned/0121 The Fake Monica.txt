 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is looking at papers.]
Joey: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel: Monica, Would You Calm Down? The Credit Card People Said That You Only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Monica: I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ross: I Think When Someone Steals Your Credit Card, They'Ve Kind Of Already thrown caution to the wind.
Chandler: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Monica: That's me.
Phoebe: Oh! The Yuk! Ross, He'S Doing It Again! (Points To A Lamp Which Is shaking behind the sofa)
Ross: Marcel, Stop Humping The Lamp! Stop Humping! Now Marcel, Come Back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-
Rachel: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Monica: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Ross: What? It's, it's just a phase.
Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Ross: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Rachel: (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ross: What?
Rachel: Let'S Just Say My Curious George Doll Is No Longer Curious. Opening Credits [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Late At Night Monica Is Still Examining Her Bill As Rachel emerges from her room.]
Rachel: Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Monica: This woman's living my life.
Rachel: What?
Monica: She'S Living My Life, And She'S Doing It Better Than Me! Look At This, Look. She Buys Tickets For Plays That I Wanna See. She, She Buys Clothes From Stores That I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Rachel: You're not an artist.
Monica: Yeah, Well I Might Be If I Had The Supplies! I Mean, I Could Do All This stuff. Only I don't.
Rachel: Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Monica: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Rachel: (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Monica: Do I Go Horseback Riding In The Park? Do I Take Classes At The New School?
Rachel: (Yawning) Nooo...
Monica: This Is So Unfair! She'S Got Everything I Want, And She Doesn'T Have My Mother. [Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]
Chandler: How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey: No, Still Too Ethnic. My Agent Thinks I Should Have A Name That'S More neutral.
Chandler: Joey... Switzerland? (The waitress brings their coffee.)
Joey: Plus, Y'Know, I Think It Should Be Joe. Y'Know, Joey Makes Me Sound Like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.
Chandler: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Joey: Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Chandler: Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Joey: (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Chandler: Might Wanna Try Joseph. (Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down.)
Joey: Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Chandler: Oh Yes! Bye Bye Birdie, Starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin Is The Fiddler On The Roof. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
Rachel: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: Hi. (On The Phone) Hi, Uh, Yes, This Is Monica Geller. Um, I Believe I'M taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Phoebe: What are you doing?
Monica: (Hushes Her) Alright, Great. Thanks A Lot. (Hangs Up) I'M Going To Tap class.
Rachel: What, What, So That You Can Dance With The Woman That Stole Your Credit card?
Monica: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Rachel: Go To The Post Office! I'M Sure Her Picture'S Up! ...Okay, Monica, Y'Know What, Honey, You'Re Kinda Losing It Here! I Mean, This Is Really Becoming Like A weird obsession thing.
Phoebe: This Is Madness. It'S Madness, I Tell You, For The Love Of God, Monica, Don'T Do It!! ...Thank You. [Scene: A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]
Monica: What d'you think?
Phoebe: Lotsa Things. (They go in and sit down.)
Rachel: Which One Do You Think She Is? (The teacher comes up to them.)
Teacher: May I help you?
Monica: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Teacher: You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Rachel: What does she mean?
Phoebe: I Think She Means (Imitates) 'You Dance A Dance Class'. Oh, C'Mon, C'Mon. (They Put On Some Spare shoes)
Monica: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Teacher: (To The Class) People! Last Time There Were Some Empty Yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Rachel: She Could Be You. (Music starts)
Teacher: Let'S Get Started. Five, Six, A-Five Six Seven Eight... (Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)
Monica: Okay, I'm not getting this!
Phoebe: (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!
Monica: Did You Ever Feel Like Sometimes You Are Just So Unbelievably Uncoordinated? (Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)
Rachel: What? You just click when they click.
Teacher: Alright People, Now Everyone Grab A Partner. (The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)
Phoebe: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Monica: Great. It's gym class all over again.
Phoebe and Rachel: Aww.
Teacher: Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Monica: Why Don'T I Just Take Off My Clothes And Have A Nightmare. (She Starts To Walk Very Slowly Toward The Front Of The Room. The Teacher Grabs Her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)
Woman: It'S Okay, It'S Okay, I'M Here, I'M Here. Sorry I'M Late, Okay, Here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Teacher: She's your partner.
Woman: Hi. I'm Monica.
Monica: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Woman: (Fake Monica) Monana?
Monica: Yeah. It's Dutch.
Fake Monica: You'Re Kidding! I-I Spent Three Years In Amsterdam. (Asks Her something in Dutch)
Monica: Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Teacher: And We'Re Dancing. A-Five, Six, Seven, Eight... [Scene: Central Perk, Ross is entering.]
Ross: (Mortified) Hi.
Chandler and Joey: Hey.
Joey: Where've you been?
Ross: At the vet.
Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Ross: She Says Marcel'S Humping Thing'S Not A Phase. Apparently He'S Reached sexual maturity.
Joey: (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
Ross: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Chandler: So what does this mean?
Ross: I'M Gonna Have To Give Him Up. Commercial Break [Scene: Central Perk, Scene Continued From Earlier. They Guys Are Sitting There like the Three Monkeys.]
Joey: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Chandler: I Don'T Get It, I Mean, You Just Got Him. How Can He Be An Adult already?
Ross: I Know. I Know. I Mean, One Day, He'S This Little Thing, And Before You know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Joey: Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross: No, No. The Vet Says Unless He'S In A Place Where He Has Regular Access To some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Joey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Ross: Well, We'Re Applying To A Lot Of Them. Naturally Our First Choice Would Be One Of The Bigger State Zoos, Y'Know, Like, Uh, San Diego... Right? But That Might Just Be A Pipe Dream, Because, Y'Know, He'S Out Of State. Uh, My Vet, Uh, Knows Someone At Miami, so that's a possibility.
Chandler: Yeah, But That'S Like Two Blocks Away From The Beach. I Mean, It'S A Total Party Zoo. (Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)
Phoebe: Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Chandler: What?
Joey: Did you call the cops?
Rachel: Nope. We took her to lunch.
Chandler: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross: What?! Are You Insane? This Woman Stole From You. She Stole. She'S A stealer.
Monica: Y'Know What? After You'Re With This Woman For Like Ten Minutes, You Forget All That. I Mean, She Is This Astounding Person, With This, With This Amazing spirit.
Ross: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Chandler: ...Take off their hats!
Phoebe: Popes In A Volkswagen! ...I Love That Joke. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]
Rachel: No way. No way did you do this.
Fake Monica: Monana was very brave.
Monica: It Was So Wild. We Told Them We Were The Gunnersens In Room Six Fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica: So Once They Caught On To The Fact That We'Re, Y'Know, Short And have breasts...
Monica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel: Go Monana! Well, You Ladies Are Not The Only Ones Living The Dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)
Fake Monica: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Monica: 'Scuse me?
Fake Monica: There'S An Open Call For Cats. I'M Thinking We Go Down There, Sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Monica: Nononononono. Think Who You'Re Dealing With Here. I Mean, I'M Not Like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Fake Monica: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Monica: What?
Fake Monica: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Fake Monica: I-I Used To Be Just Like You. And Then One Day I Saw A Movie That changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica: Uh-huh.
Fake Monica: I Thought That Movie Was So Incredibly... Boring. I Mean, That Thing At The End Where The Kid Kills Himself Because He Can'T Be In The Play? What Was That?! It'S Like, Kid, Wait A Year, Leave Home, Do Some Community Theatre. I Walked Out Of There And I Thought, 'Now, That'S Two Hours Of My Life That I'M Never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Monica: Wow. Then I Would Definitely Not Recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse. Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]
Ross: (Reading Letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We Didn'T Get Into Scranton. (To The Others) That Was Like Our Safety Zoo. They Take Like Dogs And Cows. See? I Don'T Know Who this is harder on, me or him.
Phoebe: I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Rachel: Oh, somebody will.
Joey: (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler: You're kidding.
Joey: Apparently He Was This Russian Dictator Who Slaughtered All These People. You'd think you would've known that!
Chandler: Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Joey: Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Phoebe: ...Flame Boy. [Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]
Ross: Where exactly is your zoo?
Dr. Baldhara: Well, It'S Technically Not A Zoo Per Se, It'S More Of An interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Ross: Yes.
Dr. Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Ross: No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Dr. Baldhara: Even if he were... cornered?
Ross: Well I, I don't know. Why?
Dr. Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Ross: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Dr. Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr. Baldhara: Well, If He'S Up Against A Jungle Cat Or An Animal With Horns, You'Ve Got To Give The Little Guy Something. Otherwise It'S Just Cruel. (Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)
Chandler And Joey: He- He- He Got In, He- He Got In To San Diego.
Joey: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Chandler: ...He's in.
Ross: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Dr. Baldhara: You'Re Making A Big Mistake Here. I Mean, San Diego'S All Well And Good, But If You Give Him To Me, I'Ll Start Him Off Against A Blind Rabbit And Give You Twenty Percent Of The Gains. [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Rachel Is Dusting. She Comes To The Table, Lifts All The Magazines And Wipes Under Them, Then Just Puts Them Down Again. Monica Bursts In, obviously drunk.]
Monica: Yo- hooo!
Rachel: Where the hell've you been?
Monica: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Rachel: Are you drunk?!
Monica: Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Rachel: Oh God, Oh. Great, Monica, Y'Know What, You Could'Ve Called, I Have Been Up Here, I'Ve Been Worried... (Monica is drinking from the tap)
Rachel: Monica? Monica!
Monica: Water rules!
Rachel: Yes, Yes, It Does. Okay, Look, The Restaurant Called, They Wanna Know If you're gonna be showing up for work?
Monica: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel: Okay Monica, What Are You Doing? You'Re Gonna Lose Your Job! This Is Not you!
Monica: No, It Is Me! Y'Know, I'M Not Just The Person Who Needs To Fluff The Pillows And Pay The Bills As Soon As They Come In! Y'Know, When I'M With Her, I Am So Much More Than That. I'M- I'M Monana! (The phone rings and Rachel answers)
Rachel: Hello? Yes, She Is, Hold On A Second, Please. Monana, It'S For You, The credit card people.
Monica: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Rachel: What?
Monica: They'Ve Arrested Monica. [Scene: New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]
Monica: Hi.
Fake Monica: Hey.
Monica: How are you?
Fake Monica: I'M Not Too Bad. Fortunately, Blue'S My Colour. How-How Did You know I was here?
Monica: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica: That I was not expecting.
Monica: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Fake Monica: Oh. Thanks.
Monica: No, Thank You! You Have Given Me So Much! I Mean, If It Wasn'T For You, I Would Never Have Gotten To Sing Memories On The Stage At The Wintergarden Theater!
Fake Monica: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica: I Just Can'T Believe You'Re In Here. I Mean, What Am I Gonna Do Without You? Who'S Gonna Crash The Embassy Parties With Me? Who'S Gonna Take Me To The Big Apple Circus?
Fake Monica: Monica, I Started My Day By Peeing In Front Of Twenty-Five Other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica: Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Fake Monica: There'S Nothing To Wonder About, Monica. You'Re Gonna Go Back To being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica: Not necessarily...
Fake Monica: Yes Necessarily! I Mean, I Dunno What It Is, Maybe It'S The Amish thing.
Monica: Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Fake Monica: Really? Then Why Are You Like That? [Scene: Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]
Teacher: You by the door. In or out?
Monica: In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
Teacher: You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Monica: Yeah, But At Least I'M Doing It! [Scene: The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.]
Pa: This Is The Final Boarding Call For Flight 67 To San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Phoebe: Okay. Good-Bye, Little Monkey Guy. Alright, I Wrote You This Poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Ross: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Phoebe: Oh!
Chandler: Okay, Bye, Champ. Now, I Know There'S Gonna Be A Lot Of Babes In San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Joey: I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Ross: Just, just say what you feel.
Joey: Marcel, I'm hungry.
Ross: That was good.
Rachel: (Brings Marcel A Teddy Bear) Marcel, This Is For You. It'S, Uh, Just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Ross: Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
All: Oh, Sure. Sure, Absolutely. (They Just Stand There, Then Realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)
Ross: Marcel, C'Mere, C'Mere. (He Sits Down And Marcel Jumps Down And Sits Beside Him) Well Buddy, This Is It. There'S Just A Coupla Things I Want To Say. I'M Really Gonna Miss You, And I'M Never Gonna Forget About You. You'Ve Been More Than Just A Pet To Me, You'Ve Been More Like A Be- (Marcel Climbs Down And Starts Humping His Leg) Okay, Marcel, Please, Could You Leave My Leg Alone? Could You Just Stop Humping Me For Two Seconds?! Marcel, Would- Okay, Just Take Him Away. Just Take Him. (Marcel Is Put In A Cage And Taken Away.)
