Phoebe: I'M Sorry Monica But I Knew If I Told You, You'D Get Really, Like, Judgemental And you would not approve.

Monica: Of Course I Wouldn'T Approve, I Mean, You Were Totally In Love With This Guy Who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

ROSS: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.

PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.

Monica: Please, When He Left Town You Stayed In Your Pajamas For A Month And I Saw You Eat a cheeseburger.

ALL: Huuh.

MONICA: Well, didn't you?

PHOEBE: I might have.

MONICA: I can't believe you didn't tell me.

PHOEBE: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.

MONICA: What have I not told you?

Phoebe: Oh, I Don'T Know. Umm, How About The Fact That The Underwear Out There On The telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.

RACHEL: What!

Monica: Wait A Minute, Who Told You? [Turns To Chandler Who'S Looking Sheepish] You Are dead meat.

CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.

Monica: Oh It'S Not Big, Not At All, You Know, Kinda The Same Lines As, Say, Oh I Don'T know, having a third nipple.

PHOEBE: You have a third nipple?

CHANDLER: You bitch.

ROSS: Whip it out, whip it out.

CHANDLER: C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.

RACHEL: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?

JOEY: I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.

ROSS: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

Joey: I Don'T Know, You See Somethin', You Hear A Word, I Thought That'S What It Was. Let me see it again.

ALL: Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.

CHANDLER: Joey was in a porno movie.

ALL: Huuh.

CHANDLER: If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.

ROSS: You were in a porno?

Joey: Ahh, Alright, Alright, Alright, I Was Young And I Just Wanted A Job, Ok. But At The Last Minute I Couldn'T Go Through With It So They Let Me Be The Guy Who Comes In To Fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.

PHOEBE: Yeah, is there a hair on it?

JOEY: What happens if you flick it?
 [Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, and Julie are sitting on the couch.]

ROSS: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?

Chandler: Why Yes Ross, Pressing My Third Nipple Opens The Delivery Entrance To The magical land of Narnia.

Julie: You Know, In Some Cultures Having A Third Nipple Is Actually A Sign Of Virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.

CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?

ROSS: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?

RACHEL: [to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.

Monica: Look Honey, I Wanted You To Hook Up With Ross As Much As You Did. But He'S With her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
