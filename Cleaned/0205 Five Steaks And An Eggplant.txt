ROSS: Man, I sure miss Julie.
Chandler: Spanish Midgets. Spanish Midgets Wrestling. Julie. Ok, Yes, I See How You Got there. (phone rings)
ROSS: You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Chandler: No, See, I'M Trying This New Screening Thing. You Know, I Figure If I'M Always Answering The Phone, People'Ll Think I Don'T Have A Life. My God, Rodrigo Never Gets Pinned.  (MACHINE--JOEY'S VOICE): Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Jade: Hello, I'M Looking For Bob. This Is Jane. I Don'T Know If You'Re Still At This Number, But I Was Just Thinking About Us, And How Great It Was, And, Well, I Know It'S Been Three Years, But, I Was Kinda Hoping We Could Hook Up Again. I Barely Had T He Nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
CHANDLER: What?
JADE: I got a little drunk...and naked.
CHANDLER: Bob here.
CHANDLER: (on phone) What've you been up to?
Jade: Oh, You Know, The Usual, Teaching Aerobics, Partying Way Too Much. Oh, And In case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
CHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.
ROSS: I know.
CHANDLER: I'm back.
JADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?
Chandler: Um, Absolutely. Uh, How 'Bout Tomorrow Afternoon? Do You Know Uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
JADE: Great, I'll see you then.
CHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Ross: Even Though You Do Do A Good Bob Impression, I'M Thinkin' When She Sees You tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Chandler: I'M Hoping That When Bob Doesn'T Show Up, She Will Seek Comfort In The Open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
ROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Chandler: Ok, Pure Evil, Horny And Alone. I'Ve Done This. (At Monica and Rachel's)
Ross: (On Phone) Yeah, Yeah, Everybody'S Here. Hey, Everybody, Say Hi To Julie In New Mexico.
ALL: Hi, Julie!
RACHEL: (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.
CHANDLER: Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Phoebe: Um, Is, Is There Any Chance That You'Re Rounding Up? You Know, Like From, Like 20?

Rachel: Do You Guys Ever Get The Feeling That Um, Chandler And Those Guys Just Don'T get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Joey: Yes! Yeah, It'S Like They'Re Always Saying "Let'S Go Here, Let'S Go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Phoebe: Yes, Yes, And It'S, And We Always Have To Go To, You Know, Someplace Nice, You Know? God, And It'S Not Like We Can Say Anything About It, 'Cause, Like This Birthday thing, it's for Ross.

Ross: That Doesn'T Matter. She Wanted To Call Bob. Hey, For All We Know, Bob Is Who She was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
CHANDLER: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.

Ross: Well, Pretty Incredible According To The Message She Left You On My Machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Chandler: Oh, See, I Had To Tell Her That My Number Was Your Number, Because I Couldn'T tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.

JOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
MONICA: Like?
JOEY: Charity.
MONICA: Charity?
ROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
RACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
PHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.
ROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Chandler: If You Guys Feel This Big, Maybe That'S Not Our Fault. Maybe That'S Just How you feel.
JOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
RACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Phoebe: I'M Just Gonna Pass On The Concert, 'Cause I'M Just Not In A Very Hootie Place right now.

ROSS: Whoa! You had sex today?
Chandler: Wow, It Sounds Even Cooler When Somebody Else Says It. I Was Awesome, Ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming. 
ROSS: Wow.
Chandler: Now I Know It'S Been Awhile, But I Took It As A Good Sign. (phone rings)
ROSS: Still doing the screening thing?
CHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Jade: Hey, Bob, It'S Jade. Listen, I Just Wanted To Tell You That I Was Really Hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
CHANDLER: Bob here.
JADE: Oh, hi.
CHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh?
JADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. 
CHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?
JADE: Eh.
CHANDLER: Eh?
Jade: Oh, Bob, He Was Nothing Compared To You. I Had To Bite My Lip To Keep From screaming your name.
CHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.
JADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.
ROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?
Chandler: Well, Maybe He Had Some Kind Of Uh, New, Cool Style, That You'Re Not Familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Jade: Well There Really Wasn'T Much Time To Get Used To It, You Know What I Mean? (at the concert)
MONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
CHANDLER: So, let's go.
ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Monica: You Know, The Guys Are Probably Having A Great Time. (at Monica and Rachel's)
JOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.
PHOEBE: Ok. One.
JOEY: Nooo.

STEVE: Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
MONICA: Do I know you?
STEVE: You used to be my babysitter.
MONICA: Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
STEVE: Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
MONICA: You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
STEVE: Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.

CHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.
JOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Phoebe: We Just Have To Really, Really, Really, Not Let Stuff Like Money Get--Is That A hickey?
MONICA: No, I just, I fell down.
RACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
MONICA: You know, a party, or--
RACHEL: What party?
Ross: It Wasn'T So Much A Party As...A Gathering Of People, With Food, And Music, And, and the band.
JOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
CHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
RACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?
MONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.
RACHEL: Oh!
Phoebe: Oh! I Can'T Believe It. I Can'T Believe This. We'Re Just Like, Sitting At Home, Trying To Guess Joey'S Fingers, And You Guys Are Out Like Partying And Having Fun, And You know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
ROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Rachel: What, As Part Of Your Poor Friends Outreach Program? (Monica's pager goes off)
MONICA: It's work.
Chandler: I Don'T Know What To Say. I'M Sorry That We Make More Money Than You. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it. 
JOEY: And we don't work hard?
MONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
CHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
JOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.
CHANDLER: Yes.
RACHEL: Oh!
CHANDLER: No.
Monica: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I Don'T Understand. Those Steaks Were Just A Gift From The Meat Vendor. That Was Not A Kick Back. I'Ll Just Replace Them And We Can Forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Phoebe: Oh. (Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)
WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
JOEY: Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?
MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Jade: Hi, It'S Me. Listen, Bob. I'M Probably Way Out Of Line Here. I Mean, It Has Been 3 Years, And You'Re Probably Seeing Someone Else Now, But If We Could Just Have One Night Together, Just For Old Time'S Sake, One Hot, Steamy, Wild Night... (Joey lunges for phone and misses.)
