 [Scene: At Monica and Rachel's.]

Monica: Who Da Wenny-Benny Boy? You The Wenny-Wenny-Benny-Benny Boy, Yes. Don'T Cry. Don'T cry. Why is he still crying?

ROSS: Let me hold him for a sec. There. (Ben stops crying) Huh? There we are.

MONICA: Maye it's me.

ROSS: Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.

CHANDLER: You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.

ROSS: There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)

MONICA: There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)

Chandler: Can I Uh See Something? (Takes Ben. When He Puts Him Close To Monica, Ben Cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)

JOEY: Cool.

MONICA: He hates me. My nephew hates me.

ROSS: Come on, don't do this.

MONICA: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?

Chandler: Monica, Will You Stop? This Is Nuts. Do You Know How Long It'S Gonna Be Before You Actually Have To Deal With This Problem? I Mean, You Don'T Even Have A Boyfriend Yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
 (Chandler has a basketball which he is moving closer to, then away from, Monica)

JOEY: Goo, goo, goo, waaah!

MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)

JOEY: Are you ok, Ross?

ROSS: I don't know. What's in this pie? 

MONICA: Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- 

ROSS: Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.

MONICA: No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. 

ROSS: And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.

MONICA: No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.

ROSS: Ugh.

MONICA: Oh my god.

ROSS: Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.

MONICA: Is your tongue swelling up?

ROSS: Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.

MONICA: All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.

JOEY: Is he gonna be ok?

MONICA: Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.

Ross: You Know, You Know, Actually It'S Getting Better. It Is. It Is. Let'S Not Go. Anyone for Thcrabble?

MONICA: Jacket now.

ROSS: What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.

CHANDLER: We'll watch him.

ROSS: I don't think tho.

Joey: What? I Have Seven Catholic Sisters. I'Ve Taken Care Of Hundreds Of Kids. Come On, we wanna do it, don't we?

CHANDLER: I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.

Ross: Ok, Well, If You Do Take Him Out For His Walk, You Might Wanna Bring His Hat, And there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.

JOEY: Hat, milk, got it.

ROSS: ??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!

JOEY: Consider it done.

CHANDLER: You understood that?

JOEY: Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

CHANDLER: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
 (Central Perk)

Phoebe: Hey Rach, Wanna Hear The New Song I'M Thinkin' Of Singing This Afternoon? I Wrote it this morning in the shower.

RACHEL: What's up?

Terry: F.Y.I.. I'Ve Decided To Pay A Professional Musician To Play In Here On Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.

RACHEL: But what about Phoebe?

Terry: Rachel, It'S Not That Your Friend Is Bad, It'S That She'S So Bad, She Makes Me Want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.

RACHEL: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.

TERRY: Uh--

RACHEL: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?

Phoebe: (Singing) Lather, Rinse, Repeat, And Lather, Rinse, Repeat, And Lather, Rinse, repeat, as needed.
 (Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben)

Chandler: You Know, I Don'T Think We Brought Enough Stuff. Did You Forget To Pack The baby's anvil?

Joey: It'S Gonna Be Worth It. It'S A Known Fact That Women Love Babies, All Righ? Women Love Guys Who Love Babies. It'S That Whole Sensitive Thing. Quick, Aim Him At That Pack O' Babes Over There. Maybe One Of Them Will Break Away. No, No Wait, For Get Them, We Got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.

CAROLINE: I think my uterus just skipped a beat.

JOEY: (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?

CAROLINE: I think it's great you guys are doing this.

CHANDLER: Well, we are great guys.

Caroline: You Know, My Brother And His Boyfriend Have Been Trying To Adopt For Three years. What agency did you two go through?

RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry.

Phoebe: And He'S Going To Be Paying This Woman? Why Doesn'T He Just Give Her Like A throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.

Rachel: Terry Is A Jerk, Ok? That'S Why We'Re Always Saying "Terry'S A Jerk!" That's where that came from.

PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. 

Rachel: Ok, You Know What, Lemme, Let Me Just See What Else I Can Do. All Right, Look, Look. Why Don'T You Just Let Her Go On After Stephanie Whatever-Her-Name-Is. I Mean, You won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.

Ross: Well, There'S No Way I'M Gonna Get A Shot. Maybe They Can Take The Needle And thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. 

DOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.

Monica: Doctor, Can I See You For Just A Minute Please? My Brother Has A Slight Phobia about needles.

ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?

MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. 

DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.

ROSS: Tho?
