Phoe: No, You Are Not, You Are Very Attractive. You Know What, I Go Through The Exact Same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.

CHAN: Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?

PHOE: No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.

Mnca: Chandler, I'M Unemployed And In Dire Need Of A Project. Ya Wanna Work Out? I Can remake you.

CHAN: Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.

MNCA: Please.

ALL: C'mon. Let her. Yeah.

Chan: Alright, Ok, Alright. But If We Put On Spandex And My Boobs Are Bigger Than Yours, I'm goin' home.

Phoe: Your Boobs Are Fine. Look, I Never Should Have Said Anything. Come Here. Come Here. [Hugs Chandler But Holds Her Hands Apart Behind His Back] Oh, Can'T Make.... Hands... meet....

 [Scene: Hallway Between The Apartments. Chandler Comes Out Wearing Spandex, Jogging In place. Monica is there.]

She'S Insane, The Woman Is Insane. It'S Before Work, It'S After Work, It'S During Work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
 [Phoebe enters.]

RACH: Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?

PHOE: Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.

JOEY: The guy still won't put out, huh?

PHOE: Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.

ALL: Sorry Phoebs.

Phoe: Look, I, Y'Know, I Don'T Mind Taking It Slow, I Like Him A Lot, Y'Know He'S Really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?

Joey: Maybe He, Uhh... Drives His Car On The Other Side Of The Road, If Ya Know What I mean.

PHOE: No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.

JOEY: Maybe he's. . . gay.

Phoe: Oohh, Um, No, I Don'T Think That'S The Problem. 'Cause We Went, Um, Dancing The Other Night And The Way He Held Me So Close, And The Way He Was Looking Into My Eyes I just like... definitely felt something.

RACH: Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?

PHOE: No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
 [Monica enters.]

MNCA: [to Chandler] Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.

CHAN: Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.

PHOE: [seeing Ross kissing Julie outside the window] Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.

Rach: What? [Looks, Feigns Indifference] C'Mon You Guys, I Don'T Care, I Have A Date tonight.

JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?

RACH: Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.

JOEY: But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?

Rach: Oh What, My Whole Insane Jealousy Thing? Well, Y'Know, As Much Fun As That Was, I'Ve decided to opt for sanity.

CHAN: So you really OK about all this?

Rach: Oh Yeah, C'Mon, I'M Movin' On. He Can Press Her Up Against That Window As Much As He wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
 [Ross and Julie enter.]

ROSS: Hi guys.

ALL: Hey.

Ross: Oh, Monica, I Figured I'D Come By Tomorrow Morning And Pick Up Fluffy'S Old Cat Toy, OK?

MNCA: Only if you say his full name.

ROSS: [reluctantly] Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.

MNCA: Alright.

JOEY: [to Ross] You're getting a cat?

ROSS: Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.

RACH: Together?

ROSS: Uh huh.

Rach: Ohh, Well, Isn'T That Just Lovely. That'S Something The Two Of You Will Be Able To enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.

ROSS: Hopefully.

Rach: Well. [Looks At Watch] Woah, Look At That! I Gotta Go, I Gotta Date. With A Man. Um, Ok, You Guys Have A Really, Uh, Have A Really Good Night And You Two Have A, Uh, Have A, Uh, Really Good Cat.

 [Scene: A nice restraunt. Rachel is on her date with Michael (MICH).]

Mich: I Don'T Know If Monica Told You But This Is The First Date I'Ve Gone On Since My divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.

RACH: [distracted] How long do cats live?

MICH: [confused] I'm sorry?

Rach: Cats, How Long Do They Live Figuring You Don'T... Y'Know, Throw 'Em Under A Bus Or something?

MICH: Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

RACH: That's just great. [she picks up her champagne and starts drinking]

MICH: Um, cheers.

RACH: Oh, right, clink. [downs her glass]

MICH: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?

Rach: Oh, No, Michael, It'S Not You. I'M Sorry, It'S Just, It'S This Thing. It'S Probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

MICH: Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.

MICH: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?

Rach: Ah, Hah-Hah-Hah-Ho, Yeah, He Wishes. Oh, I'M Sorry, Look At Me. Ok, Michael, Let'S talk about you. 

MICH: Alright.

 [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch.]

PHOE: So, I figured it out.

JOEY: What?

PHOE: Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.

Joey: Phoebe, That'S Crazy. When I First Met You, You Know What I Said To Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

PHOE: Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.

Joey: Phoebs Look, If You Want To Know What The Deal Is, You'Re Just Gonna Have To Ask him.

PHOE: You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. [they hug]

MICH: Fruitflies?

RACH: Yes! Thank you.
 [The waiter comes to the table.]

WAITER: So, would you like any dessert?

MICH: No! No dessert, just a check, please.

RACH: Oh, you're not having fun, are you?

Mich: No, No, I Am, But Only Because For The Last Hour And A Half I'Ve Been Playing The movie Diner in my head.

Rach: Oh, Look At Me, Look At Me. Oh, I'M On A Date With A Really Great Guy, All I Can Think About Is Ross And His Cat And His... Julie. I Just Want To Get Over Him. Gosh, Why can't I do that?

Mich: Oy. Look, I'Ve Been Through A Divorce, Trust Me You'Re Gonna Be Fine. You Just Can'T see it now because you haven't had any closure.

Mich: Well, You Know, There'S No One Way Really, It'S Just, You Know, Whatever It Takes So that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."

PHOE: And we did.

JOEY: All right Phoebs, way to go.

PHOE: Yay me.

JOEY: So, so how did it happen?

PHOE: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.

JOEY: And what did he say?

Phoe: He Said That, Um, He Understands How Sex Can Be Like, A Very Emotional Thing For A Woman And He Was Just Afraid That I Was Gonna Get All, Y'Know, Like, 'Ohh, Is He Gonna Call Me The Next Day' And, Y'Know, 'Where Is This Going' And, Ya Know, Blah-La-La-La-La. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.

JOEY: Wow.

Phoe: Yeah, So I Said, "Ok, Relax Please," Y'Know, I Mean, Sex Can Be Just About Two People Right There In The Moment, Y'Know, It'S, If He Wants To See Me Again He Can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.

PHOE: Um-hum.

JOEY: This man is my God.
 [Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is closing up and Ross comes in. Get your Kleenex.]

Ross: No, No It'S Not Interesting. Ok, It'S Very, Very Not Interesting. In Fact It'S actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.

RACH: Alright, I got it Ross.

ROSS: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.

RACH: [hurt] What?

ROSS: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.

Rach: Hey, I Was Doin' Great Before I Found Out About You. You Think It'S Easy For Me To see you with Julie?

ROSS: Then you should have said something before I met her.

RACH: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.

ROSS: There was never a good time.

RACH: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.

Ross: Not, Not, Not Every Night. You Know, And... And It'S Not Like I Didn'T Try, Rachel, But Things Got In The Way, Y'Know? Like, Like Italian Guys Or Ex-Fiances Or, Or, or Italian guys.

RACH: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?

Ross: The Point Is I... I Don'T Need This Right Now, Ok. It, It'S Too Late, I'M With somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

Rach: Yeah, What'Re You Saying, You Just Sort Of Put Away Feelings Or Whatever The Hell It was you felt for me?

ROSS: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.

RACH: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.

ROSS: Fine.

RACH: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.

ROSS: Good.

Rach: Good. [Ross Leaves]  [Rachel gets up and opens the door, yelling after him.]
