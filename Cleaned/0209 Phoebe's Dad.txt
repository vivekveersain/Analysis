PHOEBE: OK, is this really my father?

GRANDMOTHER: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.

PHOEBE: OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.

GRANDMOTHER: Look, I. . .

Phoebe: Ya Know, In All The Years That We Have Been Grandmother And Granddaughter, You have never lied to me.

GRANDMOTHER: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.

PHOEBE: Oh God.

Grandmother: It Was Your Mother'S Idea. Ya Know, She Didn'T Want You To Know Your Real Father Because It Hurt Her So Much When He Left, And, I Didn'T Want To Go Along With It, But, Well Then She Died And, And It Was Harder To Argue With Her. Not Impossible, But harder.

Phoebe: Alright, So, What, He'S Not A Famous Tree Surgeon? And Then, I Guess, Ok, He doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

GRANDMOTHER: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?

PHOEBE: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.

Grandmother: Well, I Think You'Re Better Off Without Him. Oh Honey, I Know He'S Your Daddy But, But To Me He'S Still The Irresponsible Creep Who Knocked Up Your Mom And Stole Her Gremlin.
