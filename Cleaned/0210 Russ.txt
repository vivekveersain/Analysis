 [The gang is walking to a newsstand late at night. Joey is anxiously in the lead.]
Rach: Joey, Would You Slow Down? They'Re Not Gonna Be Sold Out Of Papers At One O'Clock in the morning.
JOEY: I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
MNCA: You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
Phoe: Although, You Know What? You Might Want To Consider Wearing Underwear Next Time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.
Joey: Here It Is, Here It Is. [Reading From Newspaper] The Only Thing Worse Than The Mindless, Adolescent Direction Was Joseph Tribbiani'S Disturbingly Unskilled Portrayal Of the king.
CHAN: OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
PHOE: OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
CHAN: Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
ROSS: I don't want to.
RACH: Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
ROSS: Yeah.
Joey: Maybe They Do. I'Ve Been Doin' This Ten Years And I Haven'T Gotten Anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
ROSS: Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
JOEY: No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
Mnca: Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait One Minute. Wait A Minute. I Believe This Will Change Your Mind.

Ross: Not At All! I Love This Guy. Hey, I Was So Psyched To Hear You'Re Back With My sister!
MNCA: You and me both.
FBOB: Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
PHOE: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
FBOB: Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
JOEY: No, I'm alright man. Really.
FBOB: No, I'm picking you up.
Joey: Hey No, Seriously, I Don'T Need You To Pick Me... [Fun Bobby Picks Joey Up Off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.
Fbob: Ok, Now Before I Go, Does Anybody Else Need To Be Picked Up? [Everyone Raises their hands] I'm still gonna go.
MNCA: OK, I'll see you later babe.
Fbob: Uh, Public Display Of Affection Coming Up. You Can Avert Your Eyes. [Kisses Monica] [Chandler and Joey are watching, Rachel turns their heads away from Monica.]
FBOB: See ya. [exits]

PHOE: Fun Bobby is so great.
Mnca: Oh, Isn'T He? Oh, You Know, I Really Think This Time It May Work With Him. I Mean, He Just Makes Me Feel So Good And I'Ve Been Feeling So Lousy This Last Couple Of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.

JOEY: Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Mnca: Well, We Just Happen To Go To Alot Of Places Where You Might Drink. I Mean, How Do You Go To A Wine Tasting Without Having A Drink? Or... Or To A Club, Or To The... Zoo. [Scene: Monica, Fun Bobby, And Phoebe Sitting In Central Perk Rachel Is Serving them. She brings a mug to Monica.]
MNCA: Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
RACH: Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
MNCA: [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.
RACH: Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Fbob: [Pulls Out A Flask] Whattaya Say We Make These, Uh, Coffees Irish? [Phoebe and Rachel look uncomfortable.]
PHOE: Um, cake.
Rach: Yeah, We'Re Gonna... We'Re Gonna Get Some Cake. [Phoebe And Rachel Go To counter.]

FBOB: Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
MNCA: Bobby.
FBOB: Yeah, OK.
Mnca: Look, Maybe This Is None Of My Business, Or Maybe It Is, I Don'T Know... But, Uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Fbob: Ok, Look, This Isn'T The First Time Somebody'S Said Something To Me About This, But, I Don'T Know... I Always Made Excuses About It, Like... Uhhh... 'I'M Just A Social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
MNCA: So, what are you saying now?
Fbob: I Guess I'M Saying, I'Ll Try And Quit. I Kinda Like That You Worry About Me. [they hug]
PHOE: [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
FBOB: I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Phoe: [Sad] Ooohh, Why? [Chandler and Joey enter.]
CHAN: Hey.
JOEY: Hey.
MNCA: Hey.
PHOE: Hey.
CHAN: Guess who's back in show business.
PHOE: Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
CHAN: No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
PHOE: Oh, no.
CHAN: OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
JOEY: Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Phoe: Oh, Well, We Have To Celebrate. You Know What We Should Do? We Should Do, Like, A soap opera theme.
CHAN: Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
PHOE: Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
RACH: Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
MNCA: [gasps] You have other friends?
RACH: Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
MNCA: What?
JOEY: With a man?
RACH: What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Joey: What About Ross? I Mean, Are You Still Mad At Him Cause He Made That List About you?
Rach: Noooo, No, I'M Not Mad At Him. I'M.. I'M Not Really Anything At Him anymore.
MNCA: What are you talking about?
RACH: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
PHOE: But you guys came so close.
Rach: Oh, I Know, I'M Sorry You Guys. You'Re Just Gonna Have To Get Used To The Fact That I Will Not Be Dating Ross. [Russ Enters Central Perk. He Looks Like Ross, Except For His Chin And Hair (It is David Schwimmer in a dual role).]
RACH: Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Russ: [Sounding Like Ross] Hhhhiiiii. [Everyone Looks At Each Other In Amazement.] [Scene: Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Estelle (ESTL) is speaking on the phone.]
Estl: Stop Saying You'Re Not Talented, You'Re Very Talented. It'S Just With The Bird Dead And All, There'S Very Little Act Left. Oh, Honey, Give Me A Break, Will Ya? [A Knock On The Door] Oooh, Ooh, I'Ll Talk To You Later. [Joey enters.]
ESTL: Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
JOEY: Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
ESTL: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
JOEY: No.
ESTL: Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]
Joey: Ok, Uh.... Listen, There'S Something I Want To Talk To You About. The Network casting lady...
ESTL: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Joey: Oh Yeah, Yeah, She'S Great, But... I Kinda Got The Feeling That She Was Sort Of... Coming On To Me. And I Definitely Would Get The Part If I Would'Ve... You Know... If I would have sent the Little General in.
Estl: Oh, I See. Well, I'M Just Gonna Put In A Call Here And We'Ll Find Out What'S Goin' On And Straighten It Out. [Picks Up The Phone] Yeah, Hi, Lori Please. [Pause] Hi Darling.

MNCA: Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Rach: Ohhh, Ok. [Monica returns to couch next to Fun Bobby.]
MNCA: Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]
FBOB: Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
MNCA: Oh God, yes!

MNCA: Oh.... my... God.
PHOE: It's not that bad.
MNCA: Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
PHOE: OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
RACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Mnca: But I'M Gonna Be There... For The Rest Of My Life. I Mean, I Can'T Break Up With him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Phoe: Alright, Don'T Say That. He'S Probably Always Been Dull. You Just, You Know, Set It Free. [Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]

Joey: Yeah, She'S Totally Good Looking. I Mean, If I Met Her In A Bar, Or Something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.
Chan: Y'Know, Maybe This Isn'T Such A Big Deal. Y'Know, I Mean, The Way That I See It Is You Get A Great Job And You Get To Have Sex. Y'Know, I Mean, Throw In A Tree And a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Joey: I Just... I Just Don'T Think That I Want It That Way Though, Y'Know? I Mean, Let'S Say I Do Make It, Alright? I'M Always Gonna Look Back And Wonder If It Was Because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
CHAN: Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Joey: Yeah, But After Denise Demarco, I Had To Promote It. [Scene: A restaurant. Fun Bobby and Monica are ordering.]
WAITER: Can I get you something from the bar?
Mnca: Yes, I Would Like Something. [Looks At Fun Bobby, Changes Her Mind] No, No Thank you.

ROSS: [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
RUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
CHAN: OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
RUSS: I know what your problem is.
ROSS: Oh you do, do you?
RUSS: Um-hum, you're jealous.
ROSS: Of... of what?
RUSS: You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Ross: Hey, You'Re A Doctor Of Gums. That'S The Smallest Body Part You Can Major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.

Chan: No, I Don'T Even Think He Knew. Hey, Would You Sleep With Somebody To Get A Great job?
RACH: I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
CHAN: Me.
RACH: Why would I have to sleep with you?
Chan: It'S My Game. You Want The Job Or Not? [Monica enters from her bedroom.]
CHAN: Hey.
MNCA: Morning.
ROSS: Where ya goin'?
MNCA: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Ross: Ooooohhhh. [Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]
PHOE: What's with all the bottles of liquor?
ROSS: What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Mnca: Oh No No, This Is Not For Him, This Is For Me. That Way He'S Still Sober But I Find His Stories About Shoelaces Much More Amusing. [Three slow knocks on the door.]
Rach: Oh God, Even His Knock Is Boring. [Monica answers the door. Its Fun Bobby.]
MNCA: Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
FBOB: Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
Mnca: Sure. [They both step out into the hall.]
FBOB: This is really hard for me to say.
MNCA: Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
FBOB: Oh, no, no, it's about you.
MNCA: What about me?
FBOB: I think you may have a drinking problem.
Mnca: What These? [Holding Up Liquor Bottles] Oh, These Are, Um, For.. Cuts And scrapes.
Fbob: Look, I Am Just Not Strong Enough To Be In A Codependent Relationship Right Now, OK?
MNCA: Oh... shoot.
FBOB: Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Mnca: Ok. [They hug and kiss.]
MNCA: Take care.
Fbob: You Too. [Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]
RACH: What happened?
MNCA: Well we... we kinda broke up.
Gang: Awwwwwwww. [Ross, Phoebe, Chandler, and Rachel all exchange money.]
MNCA: [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?
Chan: I'Ll Take One. Sometimes I Like To Hold Stuff Like This And Pretend I'M A Giant. [Joey enters.]
JOEY: Hey.
GANG: Hey!
ROSS: How'd the callback go?
JOEY: It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
CHAN: So what'd you do?
JOEY: Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
ROSS: Good for you.
Joey: But Wait, Wait, Wait. Then, After I Left Her Office, She Caught Up With Me At The elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
PHOE: So... and?
Joey: Soooooo... You Are Now Looking At Dr. Drake Ramore, Neurosurgeon, Recurring In At least four episodes!
GANG: Allright!
Joey: Alright... I'Ve Got To Go Shower. [Leaves] [Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Chandler exchange money again.]

Russ: Oh, All She Said Was That I Remind Her Too Much Of Somebody. You Have Any Idea Who She'S Talking About? [Chandler and Phoebe feign ignorance.]
PHOE: Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Russ: Oh. [Julie... Ross's ex-girlfriend... enters.]
JULIE: Hey.
CHAN: Hey!
