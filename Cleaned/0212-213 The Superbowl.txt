 [Scene: In A Tv Commercial That The Gang Is Watching At Monica And Rachel's.]
 [A Guy Is Sitting At His Desk And His Boss Comes In And Drops A Huge Pile Of Papers On his desk. The guy looks dejected.]

COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...
 [A Monkey Jumps On The Desk And Hands The Guy A Beer. He Opens The Beer And Is Suddenly On the beach, in a hammock, with beautiful women all around.]

Commercial Voiceover: ...With Monkeyshine Beer. [Monkeyshine Theme] Monkeyshine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.]
 [Camera pans back from the TV to show the gang watching.]

ROSS: That commercial always makes me so sad.

Joey: Yeah, But Then The Guy Opens His Beer And Those Girls Run At Him, So, Everything seems to work out OK.

ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.

Phoebe: I Can See That, 'Cause They Both Have Those Big Brown Eyes And, Ya Know, The little pouty chin.
MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.

ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.

Rachel: Oh, Ross, You Had To, I Mean, He Was Humping Everything In Sight. I Mean, I Have A Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

Ross: Remember When Sometimes He'D Borrow Your Hat, And, And When You Got It Back There'D be little monkey raisins in it.

Chandler: Yeah, Well Sure, When He Did It, It Was Funny. When I Did It To My Boss'S Hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.

JOEY: Ah, the stalker.

ERICA: Never mind, it's open.

Chandler: [Joey Grabs A Frying Pan] Yes, Hitting Her With A Frying Pan'S A Good Idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.

JOEY: Let's get out of here.
 [They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel's door]

CHANDLER: The one time they're not home.

Joey: Ok, We'Ll Just Leave, And When We Pass Her On The Stairs, She Won'T Know It'S Me 'cause we've never met.

LIPSON: Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.

Ross: Well, I Uh, I Can'T Seem To Find The Monkey I Donated Last Year. He'S A Capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.

LIPSON: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.

ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?

Lipson: Well He Got Sick, And Then He Got Sicker, And Then He Got A Little Better But Then he died.

ROSS: I can't believe this.

Lipson: I'M Sorry Mr. Geller. But Ya Know, There'S An Old Saying, 'Sometimes Monkeys Die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.

ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.

LIPSON: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.

ROSS: Zoo dollars?

Lipson: Yes, And Come See The Bird Show At 4. The Macaws Wear Hats. Well It'S A Lot Cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.

CHANDLER: Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.

RACHEL: And she's not crazy?

Chandler: Oh No No No, She'S A Total Wack Job. Yeah, She Thinks That Joey Is Actually Dr. Drake Remore.

RACHEL: Oh my God.

MONICA: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.

Chandler: Hey, Just Because This Woman Thinks She Can Actually See Joey Through The Magical Box In Her Living Room Doesn'T Mean She'S Not A Person. I Mean, Does She Not Deserve Happiness, Does She Not Deserve Love? What'Re You Lookin' At Me For? He'S The One who wants to boff the maniac.

ROB: You OK?

Phoebe: No, Uh-Uh, I'M Just, I'M Nervous. So, You Know What, Maybe If I Just, If I Picture them all in their underwear.

ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.

JOEY: No one.

Erica: Oh Drake, You Are So Talented, Let Me See Those Hands. Oh These Hands, These beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.

JOEY: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]

Erica: No, Seriously. These Hands. These Miracle, Magical, Life-Giving Hands. Oh, Just To be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?

Joey: Alright, Just One. [She Licks His Hands Rather Emphatically] Wow, You'Re Good At that.
