 [Scene: Chandler And Joey'S Apartment. Chandler And Joey Are Sitting at the bar, in their bathrobes, eating cereal]

Joey: Man This Is Weird. You Ever Realize Captain Crunch'S Eyebrows Are Actually On His hat?

Chandler: That'S What'S Weird? Joey, The Man'S Been Captain Of A Cereal For The last 40 years.
 [Joey finishes his cereal, licks his spoon, and puts it back in the silverware drawer.]

CHANDLER: Waaa-aaah.

JOEY: What?

CHANDLER: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.

JOEY: Yeah, so.

Chandler: Well Don'T You See How Gross That Is? I Mean That'S Like You Using My toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?

JOEY: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.

CHANDLER: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.

JOEY: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?

CHANDLER: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.

Joey: Alright, Well Next Time You Take A Shower, Think About The Last Thing I Wash And The first thing you wash.
 OPENING TITLES
 [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S Apartment. Monica And Phoebe Are Sitting At The Table, Joey and Chandler enter.]

CHANDLER: Hey.

MONICA and PHOEBE: Hey.

JOEY: Hey.

PHOEBE: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?

JOEY: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.

PHOEBE: Ahh.

RACHEL: [enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.

PHOEBE: Okey-doke.

MONICA: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.

CHANDLER: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?

RACHEL: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.

JOEY: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?

PHOEBE: Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.

CHANDLER: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

JOEY: So where you gettin' it?

PHOEBE: I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]

ROSS: What? What's on your shoulder?

PHOEBE: Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.

ROSS: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.

RACHEL: Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?

Ross: No, Sorry I Don'T. Tell Me Why Would Anyone Pay Someone To Scar Their Body For Life? What If It Doesn'T Come Out Right Phoebe? Then It'S Like, I Don'T Know, Havin' A Bad Hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?

MONICA: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.

CHANDLER: Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?

MONICA: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.

JOEY: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?

MONICA: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.

PHOEBE: No, I think you should tell them.

Monica: No, I Don'T Even Know How Serious He Is About Me. Until I Do, I'M Not Telling Them anything.

Ross: I Don'T Know, I Don'T Think Mom And Dad Would Mind. Remember When You Were 9 And Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
 [Scene: The Gellers' House. Monica, Ross, And Richard Are Arriving To Mr. Gellers birthday party.]

ROSS: Alright, shall we?

Monica: Ok, Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait. You Know What? Ross, Let'S - Let'S Switch Places. You Get In The Middle. No Un-, Ya Know, Unless This Looks Like We'Re Trying To Cover Something up.

MRS. GELLER: Oh hi kids. Hi darling.

MONICA: Happy birthday dad.

MR. GELLER: Oh thank you.

MONICA: Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.

MRS. GELLER: Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.

MONICA: Are we still on that?

MRS. GELLER: We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.

Friend: She'S Probably Not Even Very Pretty, Just Young Enough So That Everything Is Still pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]
 [Scene: Joey's co-star's apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.]

JOEY: Can you believe this place?

CHANDLER: I know, this is a great apartment.

Joey: Ah, I Was Just In The Bathroom, And There'S Mirrors On Both Sides Of You. So When you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.

CHANDLER: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.

JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.

JOEY: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.

JOEY'S CO-STAR: Thanks. You want it?

JOEY: Huh?

JOEY'S CO-STAR: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.

JOEY: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?

Joey'S Co-Star: Why Not? You Hate Park Views And High Ceilings? C'Mon I'Ll Show You The kitchen.

Chandler: [Being Left Behind] Oh That'S All Right Fellas, I Saw A Kitchen This Morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
 [Scene: Mr. Geller'S Party. Mr. Geller And A Friend Are Questioning Richard While Ross observes.]

MR. GELLER: C'mon, tell us.

FRIEND: Yeah, is she really 20.

RICHARD: I am not telling you guys anything.

MR. GELLER: C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.

ROSS: Dad, you really don't want to do that.

MR. GELLER: Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?

RICHARD: Jack, would you let it go?

Mr. Geller: Look, I Know What You'Re Going Through. When I Turned 50 I Got The Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.

RICHARD: Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.

Mr. Geller: Tell You What, Maybe One Of These Weekends You Can Borrow The Car And I Cou. . .

ROSS: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.

MR. GELLER: What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
 [Scene: Tattoo parlor. Phoebe and Rachel are deciding on tattoos.]

PHOEBE: You're not going?

RACHEL: Uh-huh.

PHOEBE: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?

RACHEL: No. Well, yeah, maybe.

Phoebe: I Don'T Believe This. Is This How This Relationship'S Gonna Work? Ross Equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?

RACHEL: What's 1922?

Phoebe: Just, You Know, Long Time Ago. Well, When Men Used To Tell Women What To Do - A Lot. And Then There Was Suffrage, Which Is A Good Thing But Is Sounds Horrible. Do You want to get this tattoo?

RACHEL: Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .

PHOEBE: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

RACHEL: No.

PHOEBE: OK, who is the boss of you?!!

RACHEL: You?

Phoebe: No. You Are The Boss Of You. Now You March Your Heinie In There And Get That Heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
 [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.]

RICHARD: How ya doin'?

MONICA: I'm a twinkie.

RICHARD: Really? I'm a hero.

MONICA: Oh, this is so hard.

RICHARD: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.

MONICA: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.

RICHARD: My parents are dead.

MONICA: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.

RICHARD: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.

MONICA: Alright.

Richard: [Walks Out Of The Bathroom And Runs Into Mrs. Geller Who Is Going To The bathroom] Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.

MRS. GELLER: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
 [Monica Jumps In The Shower. Right After Mrs. Geller Enters The Bathroom, Mr. Geller Peeks his head in.]

Mr. Geller: Honey. Honey, Have You Seen My Harmon Kilerbrew Bat? Bob Doesn'T Believe I have one.

MRS. GELLER: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?

MR. GELLER: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.

MRS. GELLER: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.

Mr. Geller: Apparently, He Told Johnny Shapiro That She'S Quite A Girl. In Fact, He Told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.

MRS. GELLER: Really.

MR. GELLER: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.

MRS. GELLER: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?

MR. GELLER: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.

MRS. GELLER: [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.

MR. GELLER: C'mon, it's my birthday.
 [Scene: Chandler And Joey'S Apartment. Chandler And Joey Are Returning From Their brunch.]

CHANDLER: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.

JOEY: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.

CHANDLER: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.

JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.

CHANDLER: What?

Joey: I'M Sorry. I'M 28 Years Old, I'Ve Never Lived Alone, And I'M Finally At A Place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.

Chandler: Woah, Woah, Woah. I Don'T Need A Roommate Either, Ok? I Can Afford To Live Here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.

Joey: What'Re You Gettin' So Bent Out Of Shape For, Huh? It'S Not Like We Agreed To Live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.

CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.

JOEY: Well that's how I feel.

CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it.

JOEY: Well then maybe I will.

CHANDLER: Fine with me.
