Joey: Ok, Uh, Hey Richard, If You Had An Extra Ticket To The Knicks Game And You Had To choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?

RICHARD: Glad to be of help. Matches. [walks out to the balcony]

MONICA: I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?

ROSS: Ok fine.

RACHEL: Thank you.

ROSS: We're not done.
