 [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S Apartment. Everyone Is There. Monica Is watching stock prices on a business channel.]
  JOEY: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?

Monica: 'Cause I Was Going By It The Other Day And I Saw That There Was A Stock With My Initials, Meg, On It And, Well, Sometimes I Have To Watch For Two Or Three Hours Before It comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.

RACHEL: Ok honey, you really need a job.

ROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.

MONICA: Really.
  Phoebe: Ok, Right There. That, That'S The Third Sign Today. Right there.

ROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
  Phoebe: No, 'Cause You Just Said Dad And Everywhere I Go Today I Keep Getting Signs Telling Me To Go See My Father. Like When I Was Walking Over Here And I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.

EVERYONE: Ahh.

Phoebe: And They Were Serving Franks Which Is His First Name Minus The S At The End. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.

MONICA: His indian name?

Phoebe: No Because I Chickened Out The Last Time When I Tried To Meet Him. So I Mean coincidences? I don't think so.

ROSS: Freakish.

MONICA: Wow.

JOEY: Freaky.

MONICA: Weird, weird.
  RACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

PHOEBE: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.

MONICA: Why?

PHOEBE: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
