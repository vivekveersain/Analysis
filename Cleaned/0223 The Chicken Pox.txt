MONICA: Give it to me.

CHANDLER: No.

MONICA: Give it to me.

CHANDLER: Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]
  Monica: [She Grabs The Coffee Cup On The Table And Licks The Rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.

CHANDLER: That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]

PHOEBE: [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.

Monica: [Chandler Tries To Come Back With A Smart-Ass Remark But Can'T Swallow The muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.

PHOEBE: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
 [Chandler is visibly upset]

RACHEL: You went out with a guy in the Navy?

Phoebe: Yeah, I Met Him When I Was Playing Guitar In Washington Square Park. Ryan Threw In salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.

JOEY: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?

Phoebe: No. No, He Is My Submaring Guy. He Resurfaces Like Every Couple Years And We Have The Most Amazing Three Days Together. Only This Time He'S Coming For Two Weeks. Two Whole weeks, which means yay.
  RACHEL: So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
 [Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can't come back.]

MONICA: That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

ROSS: [enters] Hiii.

JOEY: Oh no, what happened?

 [He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]

Richard: Monica... [He Re-Enters The Bedroom And Monica Jumps On The Bed, Trying To Cover It.] Hey Mon, I Have A Question. Is Leroy The Baddest Man In The Whole Damn Town Or The fattest man in the whole damn town?

MONICA: Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.

RICHARD: What're you doing?

MONICA: Just waiting for you sweetie.

RICHARD: Are you remaking the bed?

MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.

RICHARD: Then, you're redoing it because...
  MONICA: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

RICHARD: You're pretty much running that risk either way.

Monica: Ok, You See, The Tag Shouldn'T Be At The Top Left Corner, It Should Be At The bottom right corner.
  RICHARD: Oh, well that's not so crazy.

MONICA: I'm just easing you in.

RICHARD: Oh, alright.

Monica: Alright, You See These Little Flower Blossoms? They Should Be Facing Up, Not Down, Because, Well, The Head Of The Bed Is Where The Sun Would Be. You Don'T Love Me Any More do you.
