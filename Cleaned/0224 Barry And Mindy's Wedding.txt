RACHEL: Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?

ALL: Who?

JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.

ALL: Wow!

Joey: Yeah, There'S Just One Thing That Might Be Kind'Ve A Problem. See, I, Uh, Had To kiss this guy.

CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute.

Joey: No, As Part Of The Audition. See, I'M Up For This Part Of This Guy, Who The Main Guy kisses.

Ross: Well, Hey. You'Re An Actor, I Say You Just Suck It Up And Do It. (Rachel Looks At him in disbelief) Or you just do it.

JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.

MONICA: Then what's the problem?

Joey: See After The Scene, Mr. Beatty Comes Up To Me And Says 'Good Actor, Bad Kisser'. Can You Believe That, Me Not A Good Kisser, That'S Like, Like Mother Theresa, Not A Good mother. 

Phoebe: Well, Come On, Who Cares What That Guy Thinks. What Does Warren Beatty Know About kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.
 OPENING CREDITS
 [Scene: continued from earlier]

CHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say?

Joey: Yep, This Kiss Thing Is Defiantly A Problem, Mr. Beatty Wants To See It Again On Monday. Man, I Gotta Figure Out What I'M Doing Wrong. Oh, Okay, One Of You Girls Come Over here and kiss me.

MONICA: What, forget it!

Phoebe: Uh-Huh, Let'S Go. (They Move In To Kiss) Oh, Wait I Have Gum. Okay. (They Kiss rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.

JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?

Monica: Joey, You Know, Maybe Your Just Not Used To Kissing Men, Maybe You Just Tensed Up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.

JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)

ROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)

(Da-Doom-Chesh) (To Drummer) What Are You Doing I'M Serious. Uh, The Reason She Walked Out On, On Barry Is Simply That She Didn'T Love Him, Which Incidentally Worked Out pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.

RACHEL: (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.

ROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!
