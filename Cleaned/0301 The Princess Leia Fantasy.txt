 [Scene Central Perk, the whole gang is entering]
Joey: I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
All: Did Not, She Did Not Wink At You...(Sees That Their Sacred Couch Is occupied by strangers).
Chandler: Huh. (They All Leave, Dejected) Opening Credits [Scene: Rachel and Monica's, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
Ross: I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Rachel: Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Phoebe: See, I-I Think That One That Elton John Wrote For, Um, That Guy On Who'S The Boss.
Rachel: What song was that, Pheebs?
Phoebe: (Singing) Hold Me Close, Young Tony Dan-Za. (Monica enters from her bedroom)
Phoebe: Hi Monica!
Ross: Hey Mon!
Rachel: Hey Mon! (she just walks straight into the bathroom)
Phoebe: Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Ross: Nope.
Rachel: No, it's been three nights in a row.
Ross: Yeah, She Finally Stopped Crying Yesterday, But Then She Found One Of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Phoebe: Oh, Okay That Explains It. I Got A Call At Two In The Morning, But All I Could Hear Was, Like, This High Squeaky Sound, So I Thought Okay Its Like A Mouse Or A Opossum. But Then I Realized Where Would A Mouse Or A Opossum Get The Money To Make The Phone Call. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is coming in from the bedroom]
Chandler: Morning.
Joey: Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Chandler: Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Janice: (Entering And Singing) Monica And Rachel Had Syrup, Now I Can Get My Man to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.
Joey: (sarcastically) Good morning.
Chandler: Hey, You Know What, Here'S A Thought. Why Don'T You Stay Home From work today and just hang out with me.
Janice: Oh, I Wish. Look, Honey, You Have That Report To Finish, And I Gotta Go see my lawyer. 
Chandler: I Can Not Believe That I Am Going Out With Someone That Is Getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Janice: (laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Chandler: Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Joey: (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!
Janice: I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Joey: B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Chandler: Nope, not this time.
Joey: Come on, quite yankin' me.
Chandler: I'm not yanking you.
Joey: This is Janice.
Chandler: Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Joey: Okay. All Right. You Look Me In The Eye And Tell Me, Without Blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Chandler: (Looks Him In The Eye) I'M Not Breaking Up With Her! (They Stare At Each Other For A While, Then Joey Blows In His Face) [Scene: Rachel and Monica's, Monica is entering from the bathroom.]
Monica: God, look what I found in the drain.
Rachel: What?!
Monica: It'S Some Of Richard'S Hair! (Holds It Close To Ross) What Do I Do With this?
Ross: Getting it away from me would be job one.
Monica: It'S Weird, But You Know What I Don'T Wanna Throw This Away. I Mean This is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)
Phoebe: Ooh. Oh. It Looks Like, Like A Tiny Little Person Drowning In Your Cereal. (Ross Gives Her This Look, Like 'Yeah, Doesn'T It', And Gets Up To Dump It Down the drain.)
Monica: God, what is wrong with me.
Ross: You need to get some sleep.
Monica: I need to get some Richard.
Rachel: Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Monica: I Know, I Know. I'M Just So Tired Of-Of Missing Him. I'M Tired Of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Phoebe: Maybe, because you told him not to.
Monica: What are you the memory woman?
Joey: (Entering) Their Not Breaking Up. Chandler And Janice. Their Not Breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Rachel: Well, You Know I'M Not Surprised. I Mean Have You Seen Them Together, they're really cute.
Joey: Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Rachel: Yes, Joey, I Remember, She'S Annoying, But You Know What She'S-She'S His girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Joey: There You Go! That'S The Spirit I'M Looking For! What Can We Do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ross: Well I'M Thinking That Chandler'S Our Friend And Janice Makes Him Happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.

Chandler: Well, I'M Crazy About Her Now. I Think This Could Be The Real Thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Joey: Look, what do you want me to say?
Chandler: I want you to say that you like her!
Joey: I Can'T. It'S Like This Chemical Thing, You Know. Every Time She Starts Laughing, I Just Wanna (Grimaces And Tenses Up) Pull My Arm Off Just So That I Can Have something to throw at her. 
Chandler: Thanks For Trying. (Grabs The Ticket And Starts To Leave) Oh, And By the way there is no Count Rushmore!

Rachel: Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Ross: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Rachel: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Ross: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Rachel: Okay, Ross, Phoebe Is My Girlfriend, Okay, We Tell Each Other Everything. You Know, I Mean, Come On, Guys Do The Same Thing, I Mean, What About All That locker room stuff.

Ross: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Rachel: Pretty much.
Ross: Did You Talk About The Night Of Five Times? Do You Tell People About The night of five times?

Janice: So, I hear, you hate me!
Joey: I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Janice: A Little Birdie Told Me Something About You Wanting To Rip Your Arm Off and throw it at me.
