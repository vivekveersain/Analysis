Ross: It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?

Monica: What If It'S New? I Mean, We Agreed Not To Talk Again, Unless We Had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?

Phoebe: Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.

Monica: If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?

Phoebe: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

Chandler: Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.

Monica: So, should I call him back?

The Guys: Noo! (Monica starts to go back into her room and stops) NO!

Chandler: All Right, Fine, You Know What, We'Ll Both Sit In The Chair. (Sits On Joey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.

Monica: Yes. Well I Got His Machine And I Left A Message. But It'S Okay, It'S Okay, It'S Okay, Because You Know It Was Like A Casual, Breezy Message. It Was Breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy? 

Phoebe: Well, How Could It Not Be Breezy, No, 'Cause, You'Re, You'Re In Such A breezy place.

Monica: Here, I Got It. I'Ll Will Play My Message For You Guys, And You Can Tell Me if it's breezy enough.

Joey: Monica, how are you gonna do that?

Monica: I know the code to his answering machine.

Ross: Okay, Mon, I Really Don'T Think This Is The... Okay, You'Re Dialing, You Are Dialing. (Chandler Enters, And Joey Is Standing Near The Chair, They Have A Show Down To See Who gets the chair and Joey wins)

Richard: (On Machine) "Hi, This Is Richard. Please, Leave A Message At the tone."

Machine: "You have two new messages."

Joey: Wow, What A Cool Job. (In A Machine Voice) 'You Have Two New Messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'

Monica: (On Machine) "Hi, It'S Monica. I'M Just Checking In 'Cause I Got This Message From You And I Didn'T Know If It Was Old Or New Or What. So, I'M Just Checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."

Joey: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.

Woman'S Voice: (On Machine) Hola, It'S Me, Yesterday Was Really Fun. Call Me about this weekend, okay.

Joey: Now she sounded breezy.

Monica: Well, who's voice was that?

Chandler: Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.

Monica: Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?

Ross: Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.

Monica: It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.

Rachel: Pheebs, You Go With Monica And Try On Her Green Dress. If That Doesn'T work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!

Ross: You don't, you don't know what your wearing?

Rachel: Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.

Ross: Yeah, Which, Which We Have To Leave For In Exactly Twelve Minutes. All Right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.

Chandler: All Right, You Will Notice That I Am Fully Dressed. I, In Turn, Have Noticed That You Are Not. So In The Words Of A. A. Milne, "Get Out Of My Chair, dillhole!"

Joey: Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)

Chandler: What are you doing?

Joey: You Said I Had To Give You The Chair, You Didn'T Say Anything About The cushions.

Chandler: The cushions are the essence of the chair!

Joey: That's right! I'm taking the essence.

Chandler: Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.

Ross: Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.

Rachel: Ross, That Was A Halloween Costume, Unless You Would Like Me To Go To This thing as Little Bo Peep.

Ross: Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.

Rachel: Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.

Phoebe: Oh Rach, Good, Listen Isn'T This Perfect For Me! (She'S Wearing Another dress on a hanger around her neck)

Rachel: Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

Phoebe: Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!

Ross: Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?

Rachel: No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.

Chandler: We used them as pillows when we went camping.

Ross: What?

Chandler: (shyly) The sheep.

Ross: Hey, what you do on your own time...

Joey: (entering) Where's my underwear?!

Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?

Chandler: He took my essence!

Ross: Okay, Now Hold On. Joey, Why, Why Can'T You Just Wear The Underwear You'Re wearing now?

Joey: Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.

Ross: Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?

Joey: It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.

Chandler: Well, Then It Looks Like Somebody Is Gonna Have To Give Back Somebody His cushions.

Joey: Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.

Chandler: What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?

Joey: Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)

Chandler: He's got nothing!

Phoebe: (Entering From Rachel'S Room, Wearing A Huge Bow To Cover The Stain) Okay, I'm ready.

Ross and Chandler: Oh, aaaah!

Phoebe: Rachel, Didn'T Have Anything That I Liked, So, But She Had This Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'

Chandler: What are you supporting?

Phoebe: Duh!! Christmas!

Ross: Okay, Hey, That'S Okay With Me. Two Down And I Have Exactly Twelve Minutes.... Wha, My Watch Stopped. My Watch. (Shows Chandler) Okay, See, The, The Dinosaur Tail Isn'T Going Around Any More. (Grabs Chandler'S Watch) What Time Is It? It'S 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!

Ross: Just, just, just pick one!

Phoebe: Okay, Okay, Okay, The Black. But, Oh, Do You Have Black, With The Little strappys?

Rachel: Yeahh, But, But Those Really Go Better With Pants. Maybe I Should Wear pants?

Ross: Yeah, Pants, What, What An Idea. Or Better Yet, Um, How 'Bout You Go Without Any Pants. Look, I Don'T Know What You'Re Trying To Do To Me, But Just Get Your Butt In There And Pick Out Any Shoes That Fit Your Feet, Okay. No, No I Don'T Care If They Match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.

Rachel: But I...

Ross: No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.

Rachel: All right.

Ross: Thank you!

Monica: (Entering From Her Room) Okay. I Gotta Call Michelle. I Gotta See If That was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.

Ross: It was, it was her voice.

Chandler: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.

Michelle: Hola! Hello. Hello?

Monica: Okay. That was her right?

Phoebe: Definitely.

Monica: See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.

Ross: Yay! (phone rings)

Phoebe: I'Ll Get It, Okay. (Answers Phone) Hi, Monica And Rachel'S. (Listens) Yeah, Just A Second, Can I Ask Who'S Calling. (To Monica) Oh, Ew, It'S Michelle! Ew! She, She must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.

Chandler: (To Phoebe) You Know What'S Weird. Donald Duck Never Wore Pants. But Whenever He'S Getting Out Of The Shower, He Always Put A Towel Around His Waist. I Mean, what is that about?

Monica: (On Phone) Michelle, I Only Beeped In So I Could Hear My Message. I Mean That'S Allowed. Yeah-Huh! I Mean Look, Yeah, You Know What I Would Really Appreciate It If You Didn'T Tell Your Dad About. What Do You Mean, You'Re Not Comfortable With This? Come on we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.

Ross: No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Monica: Okay, fine. (runs to her room)

Chandler: They got a phone in there, right?

Phoebe: Okay, We'Re On It. We'Re On It. (Rachel comes out from her room wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt)

Ross: Um. I Know It Says Black Tie Optional, But, Um This May Be Pushing It A little, um.

Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo.

Ross: You're not going to go.

Rachel: No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.

Ross: How, how, um how can you not be going?

Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.

Ross: Um, you know, just out of curiosity...

Rachel: Well, Ever Since I Was Humiliated And Yelled At In Front Of My Friends, I'M just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.

Ross: Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.

Rachel: It's fine.

Rachel: I'm not mad. 

Ross: No.

Rachel: I'm just not going.

Phoebe: (Yelling From The Bedroom) Get Away From That! No! (She Comes Into The living room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed.

Chandler: Is It Wrong That I Was Totally Aroused By That? (Joey enters wearing a lot of clothes)

Joey: Okay, Buddy-Boy. Here It Is. You Hide My Clothes, I'M Wearing Everything You own.

Chandler: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!

Chandler: Oooo-ooh!

Joey: Yeah. Whew, It'S Hot With All Of This Stuff On. I Ah, I Better Not Do Any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)

Chandler: Jeez, what a baby.

Joey: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.

Ross: You Know What I Don'T Care. The Only Person I Cared About Getting Dressed, Is The One Person That Says She'S Not Even Gonna Go. Look Rach, I'M Sorry. Okay. Look, I-I Wa, I Was A Jerk. I'M Sorry I Yelled. I Want You There, I Need You There. Look, What, What can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.

Ross: What?

Rachel: I think you should drink the fat.

Joey: Yaaaay!

Ross: Okay, Okay. If That Is What It Takes To Show You How Much You Mean To Me, And how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.

Phoebe: Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.

Ross: I Think This Will Be Fine. Okay, Vanilla Milkshake, Just A Vanilla Milkshake, With Chicken Bits Floating In It. Cheers. (Starts To Drink, But Rachel Stops Him Just before he starts drinking)
