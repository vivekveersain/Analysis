Ross: I know.
Dr. Green: Excuse me, you think Im cheap?

Ross: Well Mr. Big Shot Is Better Than Wethead. [Scene: Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.]
Joey: Okay, Some Tricks Of The Trade. Now, Ive Never Been Able To Cry As An Actor, So If Im In A Scene Where I Have To Cry, I Cut A Hole In My Pocket, Take A Pair Of Tweezers, And Just Start Pulling. Or Ah, Or, Lets Say I Wanna Convey That Ive Just Done Something Evil.

Ross: Yeah, Im Gonna Go To A Doctor Who Went To School In A Mini-Mall. (they go into Monica and Rachels, and see Phoebe hopping around.)
