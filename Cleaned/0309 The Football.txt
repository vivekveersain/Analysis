 [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, The Whole Gang Is There, The Guys Are watching football, the girls are cooking Thanksgiving dinner.]
The Guys: (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Phoebe: Hey, Its Your Thanksgiving Too, Y'Know, Instead Of Watching football, you could help.
The Guys: We will. (they dont move)
Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Rachel: No Mon, You Want To Put Them In Concentric Circles. I Want To Do This.  (Rachel Sticks A Marshmellow Into Monicas Nose. Monica Takes It Out Of Her Nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)
Monica: Every Year. Opening Credits [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Phoebe: Y'Know, For Once, I Am Going To Sit Down And Try To Watch One Of These things. (just as she sits down).
Ross: Halftime.
Joey: Hey, Who Wants To Ah, Throw The Ball Around A Little, Maybe Get A Little three on three going?
Rachel: Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Phoebe: Oh, can I play too? Ive never played football, like ever. 
Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler.
Chandler: No, no, no, I dont, I dont really wanna play.
Joey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Chandler: Thats Not True! I Wanted To Wear My Bathrobe And Eat Peanut Clusters All Day. I Wanted To Start Drinking In The Morning. Dont Say That I dont have goals!
Joey: Chandler, You Have To Start Getting Over Her. All Right, If You Play, You Get Some Fresh Air, Maybe Itll Take Your Mind Off Janice, And If You Dont play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even. Come on.
Chandler: Yeah, all right, Ill play.
Phoebe: Yay!!
Rachel: Lets do it! Ross?
Ross: What?
Rachel: Do you wanna play football?
Ross: Um, Monica and I arent supposed to play football.
Joey: Says who? Your mom?
Monica and Ross: Yeah.
Monica: Well, Every, Every Thanksgiving Um, We Used To Have A Touch Football game called the Geller Bowl.
Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Monica: Anyway, Ross And I Were Always Captains, And Um, It Got Kindve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Rosss nose.
Ross: It Was Soo Not An Accident. She Saw I Was About To Tag Her, So She threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Monica: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Ross: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Ho, Ho, Ho, You Did Not Win The Game, The Touchdown Didnt Count, Because Of The Spectacularly Illegal, Oh And By The Way Savage Nose breaking.
Monica: (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didnt get the Geller Cup?
Rachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Ross: Yes, It Was The Trophy You Got If You Won The Game. But Our Dad Said, Nobody Won That Game,  And He Was Sick Of Our Fighting, So He Took The Trophy And.... (Pauses To Collect Himself, As He Is On The Verge Of Tears Saying This) Threw It in the lake.
Chandler: And was the curse lifted?
Ross: Anyway. Thats When Our Mom Said We Were Not To Play Football Ever again.
Monica: Y'Know What, I Think We Should Play A Game. I Mean Come On, Its been twelve years.

Rachel: (Knocking It Down Instead Of Catching It) That Almost Hit Me In The face.
Joey: All right, we have to pick captains.
Chandler: And then Tineals.
Phoebe: Okay, so how do we decide that?
Monica: Well, why dont we just bunny up.
