 [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
Chandler: (reading the comics) Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
Rachel: What?
Chandler: Well, As Old As He Is In Dog Years, Do You Think Snoopy Should Still be allowed to fly this thing?
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah.
Gunther: Do You Remember When You First Came Here, How You Spent Two Weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Rachel: Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Gunther: (Laughs) Good One. Actually, Ah, Terry Wants You To Take The Training again, whenever.
Rachel: (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?
Chandler: (Thinks About It) Yeah? Opening Credits [Scene: The Hallway Of Rosss Building, There Is A Brown Bird Girl Selling cookies, as Ross and Chandler come up the stairs.]
Sarah: So Thats Two Boxes Of The Holiday Macaroons. On Behalf Of The Brown Birds Of America, I Salute You. (Does The Brown Bird Salute, She Blows On A Bird Call, Then Holds Her Hand, Palm Facing Out, Next To Her Face, And Then Waves It Like A Bird flapping its wings.)
Ross: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Chandler: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Ross: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Chandler: I Was Shrieking... Like A Marine. (they both start up the stairs.)
Ross: All Right Here. Watch Me Execute The Three Ps Of Championship Play. Power. (Swings The Racquet) Precision. (Swings The Racquet.) And Penache. (Does A Backswing And Hits Sarah Whos Started Up The Stairs, Knocking Her Down, They Both Watch In Horror.) [Scene: Central Perk, the gangs all there discussing the incident.]
Monica: You broke a little girls leg?!!
Ross: I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Chandler: (Reading The Paper) Says Here That A Muppet Got Whacked On Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Ross: Well, Im Gonna Go See Her. I Want To Bring Her Something, What Do you think shell like?
Monica: Maybe A Hello Kitty Doll, The Ability To Walk... (Rachel starts to laugh, and Ross notices her.)
Rachel: Im gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)
Ross: All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)
Chandler: Look Out Kids, Hes Coming! (Ross Continues To Leave With His head down in shame.)
Joey: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Phoebe: Have Fun. Oh Wait, No, Dont! I Forgot I Am Totally Against That now.
Joey: What? Me having a job?
Phoebe: No, No, I Am Against Innocent Trees Being Cut Down In Their Prime, And Their, Their Corpses Grotesquely Dressed In Like Tinsel And Twinkly Lights. (To Joey) Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Joey: Well, Im Pretty Tired From Lugging The Trees Around All Day. Hey, Phoebe Listen, You Got This All Wrong. Those Trees Were Born To Be Christmas Trees, Their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Phoebe: Really? (Phoebe Turns And Looks At Monica, While Joey Frantically Motions To Chandler To Help him out.)
Chandler: Yes. Yes, And Ah, Ah, The Trees Are Happy Too, Because For Most Of Them, Its The Only Chance To See New York. [cut to Gunther retraining Rachel.]
Gunther: ...And After Youve Delivered The Drinks, You Take The Empty tray....
Rachel: Gunther, Gunther, Please, Ive Worked Here For Two And A Half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)
Gunther: What If You Put Them Here. (Sets The Empty Tray On Another Stack Of empty trays on the back counter.)
Rachel: Huh. Well, Y'Know Thats Actually A Really Good Idea, Because That Way Theyll Be Closer To The Mugs. Y'Know What, You Should Have The Other Waitresses do that too.
Gunther: They Already Do. Thats Why They Call It The Tray spot.
Rachel: Gee, I Always Heard Them Talk About That, I Just Always Thought That It was a club they went to. Oh God, Im, Im sorry. (walks away)
Gunther: Its All Right. Sweetheart. [Scene: Sarahs bedroom, her room is decorated with a space motif.]
Ross: So, This Must Be Kinda Neat For Ya, Huh? I Mean, Your Dad Tells Me That You Get A Couple Of Days Off School, And You, You Ah, Dont Have To Sell Those cookies anymore. 
Sarah: Well, I Kinda Wanted To Sell The Cookies. The Girl Who Sells The Most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Ross: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Sarah: Yeah. My Dad Says If I Spend As Much Time Helping Him Clean Apartments, As I Do Daydreaming About Outer Space, Hed Be Able To Afford A Trip To The Taj Mahal.
Ross: I Think You Would Have To Clean A Whole Lot Of Apartments To Go All The way to India.
Sarah: No. The One In Atlantic City, Dad Loves The Slots. He Says Hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Ross: Huh. Well, Good Luck To Dad. Say, How Many More Boxes Would You Have To sell in order to win?
Sarah: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Ross: Yeah.
Sarah: So far, Ive sold seventy-five.
Ross: Four Hundred, Huh? Well, That Sounds Do-Able. (Starts To Get Out His wallet) How much are the boxes?
Sarah: Five dollars a box.
Ross: (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?
Sarah: A Ten Speed Bike. But, Id Rather Have Something My Dad couldnt sell.
Ross: Well, that makes sense.
Sarah: Could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble?
Ross: Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Sarah: Could You Pull Open The Curtains For Me? The Astronauts From The Space Shuttle Are Gonna Be On The News, And Since We Dont Have A Tv, The Lady Across The Alley Said Shed Push Hers Up To A Window, So I Could Watch It. [Scene: A Hallway, Ross Is Selling Brown Bird Cookies For Sarah, He Stops And Knocks On a door.]
Woman: (Looking Through Her Peephole, We See Ross Standing In The Hallway.) Yesss?
Ross: Hi, Im selling Brown Bird cookies.
Woman: Youre no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Ross: No, Hi, Im, Im An Honorary Brown Bird (Does The Brown Bird salute.)
Woman: What does that mean?
Ross: Ah, Well, It Means That I Can Sell Cookies, But Im Not Invited To sleep-overs.
Woman: I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
Ross: No, Please, Please, Um, Its For A Poor Little Girl Who Wants To Go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Woman: Im pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Ross: Okay, Okay! Im Going. Im Going. (Goes Across The Hall To Knock on another door.)
Woman: I can still see you!
Ross: All Right!! [Scene: Joeys work, selling Christmas trees.]
Phoebe: (walking up to Joey) Hey.
Joey: Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Phoebe: Well, I-I Thought A Lot About What You Said, And Um, I Realilized Duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...
Joey: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Phoebe: Destiny.
Joey: Sure.
Phoebe: Yes.
Joey: All right.
Phoebe: Okay. (One Of Joeys Co-Workers, Walks By With A Dead Tree.) Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled.
Joey: Oh, Thats, Thats Ah, One Of The Old Ones, Hes Just taking it to the back.
Phoebe: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Joey: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Phoebe: So, what happens to the old guys?
Joey: Well, they go into the chipper.
Phoebe: Why, Do I Have A Feeling Thats Not As Happy As It Sounds? (Joey Points Out One Going Into The Chipper To Her, As This Haunty, Demonic Music Starts To Play In The Background) No! Nooooo!!! (She Winces In Horror And Hides Her Face Against Joeys shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
Joey: (To The Guy Operating The Chipper) Hey! Hey!! (Makes The Cut It Motion With His Hands) [Scene: Central Perk, All Except Phoebe Are There, Ross Is Telling The Gang, Minus Rachel whos still being retrained, about the different cookie options.]
Ross: ...And These Come In The Shapes Of Your Favourite Christmas Characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.

Gunther: And When You Have A Second Later, I Wanna Show You Why We Dont just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.

Joey: Look Rach, Wasnt This Supposed To A Temporary Thing? I Thought You wanted to do fashion stuff?
Rachel: Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that.
Chandler: How... Exactly Are You Pursuing That? Y'Know Other Than Sending Out resumes like what, two years ago?
Rachel: Well, Im also sending out.... good thoughts.
Joey: If You Ask Me, As Long As You Got This Job, Youve Got Nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Rachel: The fear?
Chandler: Hes Right, If You Quit This Job, You Then Have Motivation To Go after a job you really want.
Rachel: Well Then How Come Youre Still At A Job That You Hate, I Mean Why Dont You Quit And Get The Fear? (Chandler and Joey both laugh)
Chandler: Because, Im too afraid.
Rachel: I Dont Know, I Mean I Would Give Anything To Work For A Designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here.
Chandler: Yeah, Thatd Be Much Worse Than Being 28, And Still working here.
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah.
Gunther: Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Rachel: Cant I just look at the handles on them?
Gunther: You would think.
Rachel: Okay, Fine. Gunther, Y'Know What, I Am A Terrible Waitress, Do You Know Why Im A Terrible Waitress? Because, I Dont Care. I Dont Care.
