 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting ready for her first day.] 
Rachel: (Running In From Her Bedroom, Wearing Only A Towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes? 
Chandler: Oh Yeah, But Don'T Worry. I Don'T Think Anybody'S Gonna Focus On That as long as your wearing that towel dress. 
Rachel: (to Ross) Tell him. 
Ross: (To Chandler) It'S Her First Day At This New Job. Your Not Supposed To start with her! 
Chandler: All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?

Ross: Why? 
Chandler: I Need You To Come To This Bachelor Party For My Weird Cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist. 
Ross: Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. 
Chandler: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? 
Ross: Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound) 
Phoebe: (Entering, With About 20 Purses Hanging Around Her Neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses! 
Chandler: (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys. 
Rachel: (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. 
Phoebe: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. 
Rachel: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. 
Ross: Honey, Just Relax, It'S Gonna Be Fine. Hey, Umm,. Why Don'T I Come Down there and I'll take you out to lunch? 
Rachel: Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. 
Ross: Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? 
Rachel: Yeah, It'S Kinda Like A 'Good Luck On Your First Day' Sort Of Thing. (To Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox? 
Phoebe: Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. 
Rachel: Oh. 
Chandler: (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday? 
Ross: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? 
Chandler: Well Apparently Albert Has No Friends. He'S Very Excited About The Bachelor Party Though. I Think Actually The Only Reason He'S Getting Married Is So He Can see a stripper. 
Phoebe: A Stripper At A Bachelor Party, That Is So Clich. Why Don'T You Get A magician?! 
Chandler: Well, If The Magician Can Open My Beer With His But Cheeks, Then All Right.  Opening Credits  [Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are entering, Joey is on the phone.] 
Ross: She'S Having Lunch With Him. She'S Having Lunch With Him. And You Should Of Seen The Hug She Gave Him When She Got The Job. And, And, And, (To Joey) He'S Really good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do? 
Chandler: Don'T Do Anything. Keep It Inside. Learn How To Hide Your Feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud. 
Joey: (Hanging Up The Phone) Yes! Guess Who'S In An Audition For A Broadway musical? 
Chandler: I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. 
Joey: It Is Me! It'S A Musical Version Of Tale Of Two Cities. So I Think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.

Ross: Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. 
Joey: What? 
Ross: Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. 
Joey: Who? 
Chandler: I'll get you the Cliff Notes. 
Joey: The what? 
Chandler: The abridgment.

Rachel: Oh, he's just goofing around. 
Ross: Ohhhhh Yeah, That'S, That'S Funny. Why Ah, Why Isn'T He Goofing Around In his own office? 
Rachel: Oh Honey, This Is His Office Too. I Told You We'Re Joanna'S Two assistants. 
Ross: Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? 
Rachel: Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? 
Ross: What?

Monica: Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it? 
Julio: I thought I would, but the translation's no good. 
Monica: Your A Poet And Don'T Know It. (She Turns Away And Makes A Face Like 'I can't believe I just said that.') 
Julio: Actually I ah, I am a poet. 
Monica: Oh, Then You Do Know It. (Pause) So Um What Kind Of Things Do You Write about? 
Julio: Things That Move Me. The, The Shadow Of A Tree, A Child Laughing, Or This lip. (points to her lip)

Monica: What do you mean? 
Phoebe: Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)
 [Scene: The Moondance Diner.] 
Monica: (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? 
Julio: What? 
Monica: Y'Know, So I Don'T Read As Many Important Books As You Do, And I Don'T Write Trick Poems That Seem To Be About One Thing But Are Actually About Something Else. And Y'Know What, I Get Excited About Stupid Stuff, Like When I My People Magazine Comes On Saturday, And The New Hold Everything Catalog. Y'Know But That Does Not Mean That I'M Empty, I Care About Things. I Care About My Friends And Family. You Have No right to make that kind of judgment about me. 
Julio: Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Monica: You don't even know me... 
Julio: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. 
Monica: What? 
Julio: The Empty Vase Is Not About You. My Baby, You Make Me So Sad That You would think this. 
Monica: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... 
Julio: No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now? 
Monica: (Sarcastically) Oh Yeah.  [Scene: Joey's audition, the director has returned and wants to see the combination.] 
Director: All Right, Let'S Do It!  (The Group Does The Same Horrible Dance That Joey Did Earlier In The Show, Except they're all out of sync and they do the jazz hands at the end.) 
Director: No, no, no. What was that? 
Joey: I know, it was the best I could get out of them. 
Director: Well, people! 
Joey: People, people, people. 
Director: Let'S Try It Again, And This Time Let'S Watch Everybody Watch Joey. (To Joey) Show 'Em How It'S Done. (To The Pianist) Count It Off.  (The Pianist Starts To Play, And Joey Readies Himself, And Then Runs Out Of The Audition.)  [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are there.] 
Rachel: So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? 
Chandler: Oh Yeah, Yeah! Look What I Got, Look What I Got. (Holds Up A Pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?

Ross: (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot. 
Rachel: A big idiot. 
Ross: A Big Idiot. Just You Have To Realize Is, This Whole Mark Thing Is Kinda Hard For Me.  (Gunther is eavesdropping in the background.) 
Rachel: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?

Ross: Well, I Was With Carol For Like Eight Years And I Lost Her. And Now If It'S Possible I Think I Love You Even More. So, It'S Hard For Me To Believe That I'M Not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. 
Gunther: Let it be me! Let it be me! 
Rachel: Honey, That'S Very Sweet, It Just Seems To Me Though, That If Two People Love Each Other And Trust Each Other, Like We Do, There'S No Reason To Be Jealous. (She kisses him) 
Ross: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
Chandler: Oh, Okay Ross. Listen, This Pen Is Kinda Getting Boring, So Can You pick me up some porn? 
Rachel: Where ya going? 
Ross: Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.

Ross: Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. 
Rachel: There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?! 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: You have a play date with a stripper?! 
Chandler: Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing) 
Ross: Ah, Yeah, Yeah. Umm, We Started Talking After She Y'Know, Did Her Thing. And It Turns Out She'S Got A Boy About Ben'S Age, So We'Re Taking Them To A Gym-Boree class. Why, is that okay? 
Rachel: Sure, is she married? 
Ross: Ahh, no. 
Rachel: Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.) 
Ross: Are you jealous? 
Rachel: Noo, I Y'Know I Don'T See Why She Has To Play With You, That'S All. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? 
Ross: You are totally jealous. 
Rachel: I'M Not Jealous. All Right This Is About, Umm, People Feeling Certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... 
Ross: Honey, I love you too. 
Rachel: Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. 
Ross: What?  (She runs over and gives him a very passionate kiss.) 
Ross: Huh. 
Rachel: (To Chandler) Well, There'S A Kiss That He Won'T Forget For A Couple Of hours, y'know. 
Chandler: Yeah. Either That, Or You Just Turned Him On And Sent Him Off To A Stripper.  Closing Credits  [Scene: The Moondance Diner.] 
Man: (entering) Is there a Julio here? 
Julio: (To Him) I Am Julio.  (The rest of barbershop quartet enters, and joins him.) 
Man: (Singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica Stands Up In The Background) You Think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. 
Quartet: Your No God'S Gift To Women, That'S All In Your Headdddd. You Are Just a buttmunch.
