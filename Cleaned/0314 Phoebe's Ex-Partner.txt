Joey: Nooo. No, No, Ah, Are You Sure It Wasnt Something That Sounded Like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Monica: No, It Was Ginger. I Remember, Because When He Told Me, I Said, (singing) the movie star.
Joey: Aww, Man. Thats The Girl I Was Hiding From. When She Finds Out hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what I did.
Monica: Well, what did you do?
Joey: What, Oh, Oh, Oh, No, No, I Cant, I Cant Tell You That, its like the most awful, horrible thing Ive ever done my whole life.
Monica: Y'Know What, Dont Tell Us. Well Just Wait Until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because itll be more fun that way.
Joey: All Right!! Okay, It Was Like Four Years Ago. Okay, Ginger And I Had Gone Out A Few Times, And Then This One Weekend, We Went Up To Her Dads Cabin. Just Me, Her, And Her Annoying Little Dog Pepper. Well That Night, I Cooked This Really Romantic dinner....
Monica: You gave her food poisoning!?
Joey: I Wish. No. After Dinner, Me, Her, And Pepper All Fell Asleep In Front Of The Fire. Well I Woke Up In The Middle Of The Night And I Saw That The Fire Was Dying Out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Phoebe: Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Joey: I Wish. See, I Guess Another Thing I Probably Shouldve Told You About Ginger Is That She Kinda Has A Ah, Artificial Leg. (Phoebe and Monica both stand up and gasp.)
Monica: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Joey: I Ran!! [Scene: A street, Chandler is kissing Ginger.]
