Phoebe: They Have The Best Stuff In There. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross has told Chandler and Joey his terrible act.]
Chandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Joey: Yeah. We Figured When We Couldnt Find You, Youd Gone Home To make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Ross: You Think?! God, I, Ah, Im In Hell. I Mean What, What Am I Gonna Do? Rachels All Like, I Love You And, And Lets Work On This. And All I Can Think About Is, What Is She Gonna Do? What Is She Gonna Say? When I Tell her what I did.
Chandler: Well, Before We Answer That, I Think We Should Address The More important question. How dumb are you?
Ross: What?! Look, Were Trying To Rebuild A Relationship Here, Right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Joey: Look, Ross Look, Im On Board About This Totally Honesty Thing, I Am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.
Chandler: Hes Right. Nobodys Gonna Benefit, And Youre Just gonna hurt her.
Joey: Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
Ross: Yeah, but dont you think....
Chandler: All Right Look, If You Absolutely Have To Tell Her, At Least Wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.
Ross: Yeah, Okay. (He Plops Down Into One Of The Leather Chairs, With The footrest extended.)
Joey: All Right, Okay, Now, We Just Have To Make Sure She Doesnt Find Out Some Other Way. (Spins The Chair Around So That Ross Is Facing Him) Did You Think About the trail?
Ross: What trail?
Joey: (Stomps On The Footrest Which Pops Ross Up Into A Sitting Position) The Trail From The Woman You Did It With To The Woman You Hope Never Finds Out Who Did It! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
Ross: Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail.
Chandler: Okay, Okay-Okay, Ah, Chloe Works With That Guy Issac. Issacs Sister Is Jasmine. And Jasmine Works At That Message Place With Phoebe. And Phoebes Friends With Rachel. And Thats The Trail, I Did It! [Scene: Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are waxing their legs.]
Phoebe: (Reading From The Instructions) After Applying The Waxine And Linen strips to leg number one, 
Monica: Did that!
Phoebe: Grasp One Of The Linen Strips By Its Easy Grab Tab And Pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Monica: Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Phoebe: Was it not pain-free?
Monica: No. It Was Painful. Oh My God , They Should Call It Pain-Zine, Now With a little wax.
Phoebe: Huh, Well, The Girls In The Satin Nighties On The Commercial Dont seem to think its that bad.
Monica: Thats Because Their Nerves Are Probably Deadened From Being So stupid. But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
Phoebe: (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Monica: Now, Are You Glad We Didnt Start With The Bikini Strips? [Scene: The Xerox Place, Ross is trying to break the trail.]
Ross: (entering) Chloe? Hi.. 
Chloe: Is this about me taking your watch?
Ross: You took my watch?
Chloe: Im sorry, I do that.
Ross: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Chloe: Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
Ross: Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?
Chloe: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Ross: You Tell, Of Course You Do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, Hi! Y'Know We havent actually met...
Issac: You dog!
Ross: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Issac: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Ross: Yeah, thats the one. Listen, I dont want to hurt her.
Issac: Oh, Hey, Man I Know, Doesnt Matter How Much We Love Em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Ross: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Issac: Aw, No Problem Dude. Y'Know We Got To Look Out For Each Other. Were the same, you and me.
Ross: Actually, no, were not.
Issac: Yeah, we are.
Ross: No, were not.
Issac: Yeah, we are.
Ross: No, were not!!
Issac: Okay, were not.

Issac: But, we are.
Ross: Fine. I just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister.
Issac: I Can Promise Not To Tell Her Again. [Scene: Phoebes Work, Ross is now trying to stop Jasmine from telling Phoebe.]
Ross: (entering out of breath) Jasmine?

Ross: Yes, I did.
Jasmine: Very bad!
Ross: Very bad.
Jasmine: Very, very bad.
Ross: Im Agreeing With You. Did You, Listen, Did You Happen To Tell Phoebe yet?
Jasmine: No.
Ross: Okay, Jasmine, Please, Please Dont. I Love My Girlfriend Very Much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Jasmine: All right.
Ross: Thank you, thank you.
Jasmine: But You Should Probably Talk To My Roommate, Because I Told Him And He knows Phoebe too.
Ross: (Angrily) Whos Your Roommate? [Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is wiping down the counter as Ross rushes in.]
Ross: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, Please Tell Me You Didnt Say Anything To Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Gunther: Im Sorry. Was I Not Supposed To? (Ross Turns Around And Sees Rachel Sitting By The Window. She Is Just Glaring At Him.) Commercial Break [Scene: Monicas Bedroom, Monica And Phoebe Are Removing The Rest Of Their Wax strips.]

Phoebe: Were all right.
Monica: Its okay, its okay.
Phoebe: Were all right.
Monica: We were just waxing our legs.
Chandler: Off?!!
Phoebe: For Your Information, This Happens To Be A Pain Like No Man Will Ever experience.
Chandler: Yeah, Well I Dont Think You Can Make That Statement, Unless youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Joey: Yeah, I-I Think That Women Just Have A Lower Threshold Of Pain Than Men, thats all. I mean, come on, its just a little wax.
Phoebe: Oh Yeah, Come Here. (Puts A Little Wax On Joeys Arm And Puts A strip on it.)
Chandler: Oh, thats mature.
Joey: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Phoebe: Uh-huh.

Ross: Listen. Oh Hey, Hey, The Important Thing Was That She Meant, She Meant nothing to me!
Rachel: And Yet She Was Worth Jeopardising Our Relationship!!  (She Throws The Paper At Him, Misses And Hits Monicas Door, They All Jump Back At the sound.)
Ross: Look, I Didnt Think There Was A Relationship To Jeopardise. I thought we were broken up. 
Rachel: We were on a break!

Ross: Okay, Well Here We Are. Now Were In A Tough Spot Again, Rach. What Do You Want To Do? How Do You Want To Handle It? Huh? Do You Wanna Fight For Us? Or, Do You Wanna Bail? (Sits Down Next To Her) Look, I, (On The Verge Of Tears) I Did A Terrible, Stupid, Stupid Thing. Okay? And Im Sorry, I Wish I Could Take It Back, But I Cant. (We See Monica And Phoebe Are Almost In Tears.) I Just Cant See Us Throwing Away Something We Know Is So Damn Good. Rachel, I Love You So Much. (He Kisses Her On Her Shoulder, Then Her Neck, Then The Side Of Her Face, Then Just before he kisses her on the lips....)
Rachel: No Ross!! (Stands Up And Moves Away From Him) Dont! You Cant Just Kiss Me And Think Youre Gonna Make It All Go Away, Okay? It Doesnt Work that way. It doesnt just make it better. Okay?
