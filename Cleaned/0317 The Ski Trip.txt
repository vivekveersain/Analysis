Chandler: Yeah Y-You, How Hard Is It To Say Something? Rachel Came Over To borrow something.
Joey: Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Phoebe: Wait. Why Was He Yelling At Her? Hes The One Who Slept With someone else. 
Joey: Well, I Guess He Says That Because They Were On A Break When It Happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Phoebe: Whoa!! He Is Soo Unreasonable! God, Although I Think I Understand What He Means. Oh My God, This Is Like 60 Minutes, Okay, When, When, At First Youre Really Mad At That Pharmaceutical Company For Making The Drug And Then Y'Know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Chandler: Y'Know What This Is Like? This Is Like When My Parents Got Divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Phoebe: Y'Know I Had A Dream Where Ross And Rachel Were Still Together, They never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
Joey: I had the same dream!
Phoebe: Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. 
Joey: Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Chandler: Y'Know What Maybe Its Gonna Be Okay, I Mean Its Been A week.
