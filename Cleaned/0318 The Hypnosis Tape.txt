 [Scene: Central Perk, all but Chandler are there, Joey laughs for no apparent reason.]
Monica: (to Joey) Whats so funny?
Joey: Oh, Nothing, No. Its An Acting Exercise, Im Practising My Fake laugh.
Monica: Oh. (she laughs)
Joey: What-Whats So Funny? (Chandler enters with a cigarette.)
Gunther: (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, theres none of that in here.
Chandler: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Gunther: Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Chandler: Okay. (Chandler hands him the cigarette, and he takes a long drag.)
Gunther: Oh Dark Mother, Once Again I Suckle At Your Smokey Tit. (Hands Chandler back the cigarette.)
Chandler: No-No, Why Dont You Hang On To That One. (He Goes And Sits Down Next To Rachel And Puts A Cigarette In His Mouth, Which Rachel Takes Away From Him. He Puts Another Cigarette In His Mouth, And Rachel Takes It Away again.)
Chandler: Okay, thats like the least fun game ever.
Rachel: Well, Im Really Sick Of Your Smoking, So I Brought Something That is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
Chandler: Oh. (Takes The Cassette And Puts It On His Arm Like The Stop Smoking Patch, And It Falls Off.) Nope, That Patch Is No Good. (Joey And Monica Both Do Their Fake laughs.)
Rachel: Come On, Its A Hypnosis Tape. This Woman At Work Used It For Two weeks straight and she hasnt smoked since.
Ross: Pffhah.
Rachel: (to Ross) Whats your problem?
Ross: Nothing, its just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Rachel: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Ross: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Rachel: Oh Right, Cause You Always Pull Your Pants Down At The Count Of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.

Alice: Y'Know, I Mean, Really We Do Realise That Theres An Age Difference between us.
Phoebe: Oh good! Okay. Cause you were acting like you didnt.
Alice: Oh No, But When It Comes To Love, What Does Age Matter? (They Both Growl And Hiss At Each Other And Then Kiss Passionately Again.) [Scene: Chandlers bedroom, Chandler is listening to the hypnosis tape.]

Phoebe: No, I Know, I Know, That This Is Franks Life, (Walks Behind Them, They Turn Around In The Leather Chairs To Face Her) Y'Know. Y'Know, I Dont Want To be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong!
Ross: Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Phoebe: No-No, Oh, Im Fine With The Age Thing Y'Know, Until It Starts sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat! 
Joey: Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Phoebe: But, I Mean, Do You Think Hes Gonna Enjoy It When Hes Up To His Elbows In The Diapers From All The Babies They Have To Have Right Away?!
