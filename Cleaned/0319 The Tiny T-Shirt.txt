So-So Thats-Thats What Im Doing, Now. (Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room)
Rachel: Wow! Umm.... (Shes Interrupted By A Loud Crash And The Sound Of Braking Dishes. Followed quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.)
Gunther: I Dropped A Cup. Opening Credits [Scene: The Hallway Between The Two Apartments, Pete And Monica Are Returning From their date.]
Pete: ...So Y'Know, Thats Why, Within A Few Years, That Voice Recognition Is Gonna Be Pretty Much Standard On Any Computer You Buy. Y'Know, So You Could Be Like-Like, Wash My Car. Clean My Room. Its Not Gonna Be Able to do any of those things, but itll understand what youre saying.
Monica: Oh, this is so great.
Pete: Yeah, it was.
Monica: All Right Then. (He Leans In To Kiss Her Goodnight, But She Quickly Kisses Him On The Cheek And Pats His Shoulder.) Bye. (She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.)

Joey: (Entering, Dancing And Singing) Oh Mommie, Oh Daddie, I Am A Big Old Baddie! Oh Mommie, Oh Daddie, I Am A Big Old Baddie! (He Dances Around The Dinner Table and exits)
Ross: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Monica and Phoebe: Oh.
Chandler: Yeah, Either That, Or Gloria Estefan Was Right, Eventually, The Rhythm Is Going To Get You. [Scene: A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play hes in.]
The Director: Joe. Hows it going?

Kate: That Info-Mercial! For The Milk Carton Spout Thing! Youre-youre-youre the guy that doesnt know how to pour milk!!
Joey: See, I Actually Can Pour Milk, But I Got You Believing That I couldnt. Now, see, thats acting.
Kate: Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Joey: Yeah, That Was Real. [Scene: Central Perk, Rachel Is Telling Phoebe About Mark, As Gunther Eavesdrops Behind them.]
Phoebe: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Rachel: I know.
Phoebe: What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Rachel: Well, I told him I would think about it, but Im gonna tell him no.
Phoebe: Huh. (Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.)
Rachel: I Mean I Think Id Say No To Anybody Right Now. (Hearing This Gunther Swoops Back To Cleaning Tables.) Oh, But It Was So Strange. I Mean Im Standing There With This Charming, Cute Guy, Whos Asking Me To Go Out With Him, Which Im Allowed To Do, And I Felt Guilty. Y'Know, Like Id Be Cheating On Ross or something.
Phoebe: Wow. So, Okay, Maybe That Means That, Youre Not Over Ross Yet And you have issues with your father.
Rachel: I dont have any issues with my Father.
Phoebe: Okay, So Its Probably Just The Ross Thing Then. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.]
Joey: I Hate This Woman!! I Hate Her! She Told Everyone In The Company About That Info-Mercial, And Now They All Keep Asking Me To Open Their Drinks. Okay, And whenever I cant do it, theyre all like-like laughing at me.
Ross: (entering) Hello.

Chandler: Its Possible. You Are Very Loveable, Id Miss You If I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
Ross: Then be supportive like a guy.

Ross: Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Rachel: (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Ross: Oh-Oh, Okay, Okay! (He Quickly Takes Off His Sweater In Order To Put On The T-Shirt. Its An Old Frankie Says Relax T-Shirt, That Barely Fits Him. Rachel Nods Her Head In Approval Of The New Look.) If You Dont Mind Im Gonna The Rest Of My Stuff, And Relax, In My Favourite Shirt. (Starts To Leave) You Have A Pleasant Evening. (He Exits And Leaves The Door Open.) [Scene: Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.]
Phoebe: So, youre like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
Chandler: And youre our age. Youre our age.
Phoebe: Y'Know What, You Should Like, You Should Buy A State And Then Just Name it after yourself.
Pete: What like Pete Dakota?

Monica: Absolutely! (He Goes To Kiss Her, But She Stops Him And Rubs His Head And Says...) Now Get Out Of Here You!! (Pete Leaves) (To The Gang) Okay, Im Running Out Of Places I Can Touch Him! Look, Is There Something Wrong With Me? I Mean Why Am I Only Attracted To Guys Where Theres No Future? Either Theyre Too Old, Or Theyre Too Young, And Then Theres Pete Whos-Whos Crazy About Me, And Whos Absolutely Perfect For Me, And Theres Like Zip Going On! I Mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?!
Phoebe: Yeah, Kinda. [Scene: The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.]
Kate: Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey: Well, Why Dont You Tell Me What Youre Supposed To Be! Huh? Because I Sure As Hell Cant Figure It Out! I Talk To You And Nothin. You Look at me, and its nothin. (He kisses her) Nothing.
The Director: Tasty! Im Really Starting To Feel Like You Guys Have A history, its-its nice.
Kate: I have a question about this scene.
The Director: Yes?
Kate: Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.
The Director: Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
Joey: Yeah.
Kate: I Think My Characters Gonna Need A Little Bit More Of Reason Than that.
Joey: Oh, Hey, How About This One. Ah, Its Says So In The Script! Y'Know Ah, I-I Dont Know Why My Character Likes You Either, I Mean It Says In The Script here that youre a bitch.
Kate: It doesnt say that in the script.
Joey: It Does In Mine! [Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.]
Chandler: I Can Blow Dry It. I Can Put Gel On It. It Doesnt Matter, I Still Wind Up With This Little (Pats The Flat Spot On The Back Of His Head) Cowlicky Thing on the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. Does it bug you?
Ross: You Bug Me. [Rachel Comes Out Of Her Apartment, Followed By Mark, And They Leave On Their Date, without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.]
Chandler: Is There Any Chance You Didnt See That? Commercial Break [Scene: Chandler And Joey'S, Chandler Is Watching A Basketball Game, Ross Is Staring out the peephole.]

Chandler: You didnt just break up.
Ross: Hey, its been like three weeks!

Ross: Juice, I need...
Chandler: Shes Moving On! Okay, If Its Not This Guy, Its Gonna Be Somebody Else! And Unless Youre Thinking About Subletting My Peep Hole, You Are Going To Have To Get Used To The Fact That The Relationship Is Over! Okay, Man? Its over.
Ross: Yeah, okay. 
Chandler: Okay.

Mark: Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Rachel: Oh. Thats So Monica Can Keep Track. That Way If One On Them Is Missing, She Can Be Like, Wheres Number 27?! (She Sits Down, And Mark Leans Over And Kisses Her. Rachel Doesnt React. He Tries it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.)
Rachel: Y'know what?
Mark: No. And I dont think Im gonna want to.

Monica: Sure.
Pete: Where are we? 
Monica: (Looks Around) Well, With All These Doctors And Nurses, Im Gonna say, midget rodeo.
Pete: Just tell me the truth.

Chandler: I Dont Think This Town Is Big Enough For Both Of Us To Relax In. (He Blows On His Hand) Draw!! (He Quickly Pulls The Lever To Raise The Foot Rest, Like A Gunfighter In A Western.)  (Joey enters.)
Chandler: (To Joey) I Wasnt Doing Anything. (Joey Starts Angrily Throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?
