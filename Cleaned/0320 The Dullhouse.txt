Joanna: (entering) Did he call?
Rachel: No. Sorry.

Joanna: Sophie, Would You Please Climb Out Of My Butt. Why Hasnt He called, Rachel? Why?
Rachel: Okay, Okay. Umm, Well Ah, Maybe He, Maybe He Feels Awkward Because You are my boss.
Joanna: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Rachel: Well...
Joanna: The Only Person That Should Feel Awkward Is You, And You Didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
Rachel: No. I...

Rachel: (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
Chandler: Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Rachel: Why Hasnt He Called Rachel? Why? Why? I Dont Understand. Why? He Said Hell Call. Why? Why? Chandler Im Telling You She Has Flipped Out, shes gone crazy!
Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
Rachel: Come On, This Isnt Funny. She Thinks Its My Fault That You havent called her. You have to call her!
Chandler: Look, You Cant Call Somebody After This Long Just To Say, In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!
Rachel: Well then youre going to have to take her out again.
Chandler: Nooo!! Shes Really Dull! And She Gets This Gross Mascara Goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Rachel: I Dont Care! I Dont Care! You Are Going To Have To Take Her Out Again And End It, And End It In Way That She Knows Its Actually Ended. And, I dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Chandler: All Right! Fine! But Its Just A Lunch Date, No More Than An Hour! And From Now On I Get My Own Dates, I Dont Want You Setting Me Up With Anybody ever again!
Rachel: Thats fine!
Chandler: Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Rachel: I Know. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross: Mon?
Monica: (From The Bathroom) Im In The Shower! [He Closes The Door And Walks Over To Get Something From The Fridge. He Starts To Smell Something And Turns Around To See Phoebes Dollhouse Smoking. He Runs Over And Takes off the roof to reveal that the dollhouse fire.]
Ross: Oh, Fire! There, Theres A Fire! Fire!! [He Tries To Blow It Out, And Obviously, It Doesnt Work. He Runs Over To The Sink To Get A Glass Of Water To Put Out The Fire, But Since Monica Is In The Shower The Water Pressure Is Very Low And Takes A Long Time To Fill The Glass. In Desperation He Takes The Half Full Glass Over And Dumps It On The Fire, It Doesnt Work. He Then Picks Up The Dollhouse And Considers Bringing It Over To The Sink, But Decides To Take It Into The Bathroom And Use The Shower To Put It Out. He Kicks Open The Door And We Hear Monica Scream At The Top Of Her Lungs.] [Scene: The Theatre, Kate is arriving for rehearsal.]

Rachel: (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Chandler: Noo!

Chandler: Look, Im sorry. Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Rachel: Okay, You Are Going To Tell Her And Youre Going To Tell Her Now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
Chandler: AhhhhIm not going to call you.
