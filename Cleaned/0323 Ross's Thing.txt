Joey: (with a disgusted look) What was it?
Ross: Well, I Don'T Know, It'S-It'S Kinda In A Place That'S Not... It'S Not Visually Accessible To Me, And I Was Hoping Maybe You Guys Could-Could Help Me Out. (starts to take off his pants)
Chandler and Joey: Whoa!!!
Chandler: No!!
Ross: Come On You Guys, It'S No Big Deal! (He Turns Around And Shows Him His thing.)
Chandler: Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.
Ross: Well What Is It? Is It A Mole? (He Moves Closer To Them, And They Jump back.)

Ross: Ahhh.
Joey: Yeah, Right. (Rachel Backs Out With A Confused Look On Her Face.) Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, And Rachel Are There, As Phoebe Enters With Her date.]
Phoebe: (To Her Date) Okay, And Then This Is The Coffee House. This Is Where I play my music. (points to the stage)
Vince: Good deal.
Phoebe: Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Rachel: Hi!
Chandler: Hey!
Vince: Hey!
Phoebe: Vince is a fireman.
Rachel: Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Vince: 98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Chandler: Well, Y'Know If Joey And I Played With Matches We Could Get You Up To an even hundred. 
Vince: (dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son.
Chandler: You're right, I know.
Vince: (To Phoebe) Look, I Gotta Go. I'M On Call Tonight. (Kisses Her) See You Saturday. (leaves)
Phoebe: Okay. (watches him leave)
Rachel: Wow, He'S Cute, Pheebs! But I Thought You Just Started Dating That Kindergarten teacher.
Phoebe: Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Rachel: What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Phoebe: I Know, I Know! I'M Like Playing The Field. Y'Know? Like, Juggling Two Guys, I'M Sowing My Wild Oats. Y'Know? Y'Know, This Kind'Ve Like Y'Know Oat-Sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Joey: So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Phoebe: Does A Dog'S Lips Move When He Reads? (Joey Makes An `I Don'T Know' face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Joey: Hey.
Rachel: Hi! (He goes over and sits down at the counter, all depressed.)
Joey: (going over to him) Well?!
Chandler: (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Ross: Well, He Said There'S Definitely Nothing To Worry About, It'S Totally benign.
Joey: Well what is it?!
Ross: He Couldn'T Even Tell Me! He Said It Was Just Some Sort Of Skin... Abnormality. And The Worst Thing Is He-He-He Said, He Said, Without Being Able To Identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Chandler: Y'Know What? You Should Go To My Guy, Because When I Went In There With My Third Nipple. He Just Lopped It Right Off. Y'Know? So I Guess I'M Lucky. I Mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Ross: At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Joey: Oh! Maybe They'Ll Name Yours After You! Y'Know, They'Ll Call It, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Ross: (Sarcastic) Yeah, That'D Be Cool! [cut to Phoebe and Rachel as Monica returns from the bathroom]
Monica: Pete's breaking up with me.
All: What?!
Monica: I Just Checked My Messages, And He Said That When He Gets Back From Atlanta, we need to talk.
Rachel: And?
Monica: Well That'S It. People Never Say `We Need To Talk' Unless It'S Something bad.
Joey: Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Monica: Really?!
Joey: Yeah, Maybe He Just Cheated On You. [Scene: A Street, Phoebe is walking with her second date, Jason.]
Jason: ...And I Know I'Ll Never Miss Doing It, But I Gotta Tell You, It'S Pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
Phoebe: That Is So Great! Oh, I... (Sees That A Parked Car Near Them Has Caught on fire) Oh my God!
Jason: Whoa!
Phoebe: (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!
Jason: Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Phoebe: (stopping him) No! No! 
Jason: No, no?
Phoebe: Well, We Don'T N-N-N-N-Need A Fireman, We'D, We'D Like A Good Mechanic. (Hears The Sound Of Approaching Sirens) Oh My God, Here They Come! Well, We Gotta Get Out of here!
Jason: W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Phoebe: Well Look, If I Wanted To See A Fireman, I Would Date One. Okay? (She Drags Him Away) [Scene: A Doctor's Office, Ross is having his thing looked at by Dr. Rhodes.]
Ross: Th-Th-That'S All It Is, A Third Nipple. Y'Know? Just Your Run-Of-The-Mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Dr. Rhodes: Take Your Shirt Off, And Let'S See What We'Re Dealing With Here. (Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?
Ross: Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Dr. Rhodes: Well that's not a third nipple.
Ross: No?
Dr. Rhodes: First of all, it's on your ass.
Ross: Well then, what is it?!
Dr. Rhodes: Wait A Minute, Hold It. (He Goes To The Door And Opens It.) Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
Dr. Johnson: I'm with Hamilton!
Dr. Rhodes: He'S Good With Rear Things, Bring Him In Too. [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are there.]
Monica: (Starting To Get Up) I Gotta Go Water Pete'S Plants. (Stops) Y'Know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Chandler: Well, If He'S Gonna Break Up With You, Maybe Joey And I Should Water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Joey: Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Phoebe: (Entering With Rachel) And I-I Can'T Take It! Y'Know? I'M Just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Rachel: Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Phoebe: (disgusted) Uh.
Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Phoebe: Well, It Just, It Doesn'T Feel Like Playing Anymore, It Feels Like Work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Rachel: So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Monica: Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Phoebe: Well, Vince Is Great, Y'Know `Cause, He'S Like A Guy, Guy. Y'Know? He'S so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)
Joey: Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Phoebe: Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Chandler: Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Joey: Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Phoebe: Jason is not a sissy!
Joey: Oh No-No-No-No, I Meant Chandler. [Scene: Dr. Rhodes'S Office, A Rather Large Group Of Doctors Has Now Gathered To Take A Look At Ross'S Thing. Ross Is None Too Pleased With The Developments, He Has A Disgusted look on his face.]
Ross: Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Dr. Rhodes: Thank You Soo Much For Coming On Such A Short Notice. Ladies And Gentlemen, I'Ve-I'Ve-I'Ve Been Practicing Medicine For Twenty-Three Years, And I'M Stumped.  (He removes the blanket covering the thing.)
