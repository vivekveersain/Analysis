Monica: Well, youre not gonna get going are you?
Pete: Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Monica: Well, no. But...
Pete: Well Im Not Gonna Stop Until Im The Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Monica: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Pete: Let Me Tell You A Story. When I Set Out To Create Moss 865, Do You Think It Just Happened Overnight? No. There Was Moss 1, That Burnt Down My Dads Garage, There Was Moss 2 That Would Only Schedule Appointments In January, And 862 Others That I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Monica: You didnt know that already?
Pete: Look, Im gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.

Ross: Hot dog?
Monica: Four, Please. (Ross Looks At Her) Im Really Nervous. (Ross Gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)
Phoebe: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Ross: What? Oh! I Gotta Tell You, I-I Wasnt Expecting To Like Her At All, I Mean I Actually Wasnt Expecting To Like Anyone Right Now, But Shes Really terrific.
Phoebe: Ohh, thats too bad!
Ross: No, I-Im saying I liked her.
Phoebe: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Ross: Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
Phoebe: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Chandler: (joining them) Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?

Joey: (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fights starting!
Ross: Okay, Well Be Right In. (To Chandler) So Ah, Did Your Boss Try To slap you again today?
Chandler: Nine Times! Okay, I Had To Put On Lotion! But, Its Gonna Be Okay, Because As Of Tomorrow Im Conducting An Experiment, And If All Goes As planned, my butt will be smack free.

Chandler: Im A Little Bit Uncomfortable With The That Way You Express yourself.
Doug: Oh, Is It The Swearing? I Mean Is It The Constant Swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Chandler: No, No. It-Its Not About The Swearing, Its More About Ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Doug: Oh?
Chandler: Oh, And Dont Get Me Wrong, I Appreciate The Sentiment. Its Just That I, I Have A Rather, Sensitive Posterior, And Ah, Besides, Its Making All the other guys jealous.
Doug: Well, Say No More. Y'Know It Takes Guts To Bring This Up. Bing! Youre okay.
