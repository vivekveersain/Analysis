Joey: (Lying On A Beach Towel, Recapping What Happened In The Last Episode) Okay, So We Went To The Beach, Because Phoebe Found Out About This Lady Who Knew Her Mom And Dad, And I Dont Really Know What Happened With That. [cut to Phoebe Sr.s house, from the last episode]
Phoebe Sr.: (to Phoebe) Im your mother.
Phoebe: Ehh? [Cut To Monica Opening The Door Of The Beach House, With Chandler Trying To Pick Her Up for a date.]
Joey: (Voice-Over) Oh, And Then Monica Joked That She Wouldnt Go Out With a guy like Chandler...
Chandler: (To Monica) (In A Funny Voice) Hi There. (Monica Turns Her Head Away in disgust)
Joey: (Voice-Over) ...And He Couldnt Let It Go, And... I Dont Really Know What Happened With That Either.  [cut to a montage of scenes involving Bonnie, Ross, and Rachel from the last episode.]
Joey: (Voice-Over) Oh-Oh! And Then Rosss New Girlfriend, Bonnie, Shows Up And Rachel Convinced Her To Save Her Head. And Then Ross And Rachel Kiss, And Now Ross Has To Choose Between Rachel And The Bald Girl And I Dont Know What Happened There Either...  [cut back to Joey on the beach towel]
Joey: Y'Know What, Hold On, Let Me Go Get Chandler. (Gets Up And Leaves.) [Scene: The Beach House, Its The Same Scene From The End Of Last Year, With Ross In Front Of The Two Doors Of Rachels And Bonnies Rooms, Trying To Decide Which door to choose.

Ross: (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.
Rachel: Whoa! What?! Why?!
Ross: Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Rachel: Here?! Now?!
Ross: Well, Yeah. I Cant-I Cant Stay Here All Night, And If I Go In there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
Rachel: Well, cant you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Ross: No, She Likes That. Yeah. Faking Sleep Doesnt Work Either, I cant tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Rachel: (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
Ross: Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Rachel: I Dont Know. (they kiss again)
Ross: Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasnt every morning.
Rachel: Oh, making it worse!
Ross: Okay. Opening Credits [Scene: Phoebe Sr.S House, Its Right After She Told Phoebe That Shes her birth mother.]
Phoebe Sr.: So I guess youd like to know how it all happened. 
Phoebe: I-I Mean I, Well I Think I Can Figure It Out. I Guess Y'Know I Was Born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Phoebe Sr.: Noo! No! It Wasnt Like That I... Remember How I Told You How Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
Phoebe: How close?
Phoebe Sr.: Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Phoebe: I dont even know how that would work!
Phoebe Sr.: Well, we were...
Phoebe: (interrupting) Im not asking!
Phoebe Sr.: Well, Any How, Some How I Got Pregnant, And, And I Was Scared. I Was Stupid And Sellfish, And I Was 18 Years Old. I Mean, You Remember What Its Like To be eighteen years old?
Phoebe: Yeah. Lets See, My Had Mom Killed Herself, And My Dad Had Run Off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Phoebe Sr.: Well, Im So Sorry. I Thought I Was Leaving You With The Best Parents In The World, I Didnt Even Hear About Your Mom And Dad Til A Couple Of Years Ago, And By Then You Were Already Grown Up. I Dont Know, Youre Here, And I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Phoebe: Yeah, Well, Everybody Does! Im A Really Cool Person. And Y'Know You Had 29 Years To Find That Out, But You Didnt Even Try! Y'Know What, You Walked out on me, and Im just, Im gonna do the same thing to you.
Phoebe Sr.: Wait!
Phoebe: I Dont Ever Want To See You Again!  (She walks out and slams the door.)
Phoebe: (Walking Back In With Her Hand Over Her Eyes.) Umm, Wheres My Purse? [Scene: The Beach House, Joey And Chandler Are Sitting At The Dinner Table, Monica Is looking in the fridge.]

Phoebe: (turning around, insistently) Monica!
Monica: Oh. [Scene: The Beach House, Rachels Bedroom. She Is Finishing Up Writing Something as Ross walks through the door.]
Ross: Its over.
Rachel: Oh, was it awful?
Ross: Well, It Was Loong. I Didnt Even Realise How Late It Was, Until I Noticed The 5 Oclock Shadow On Her Head. (They Both Start To Laugh, Then Stop Themselves Quickly.) Anyway, She Didnt Want To Stay. I Called A Cab; She Just Left. (They kiss.)
Rachel: I wrote you a letter.
Ross: Ohh! Thank You! I Like Mail. (He Goes To Kiss Her Again, But She Turns away.)
Rachel: (Handing Him The Letter) Its Just Some Things Ive Been Thinking About. Some Things About Us, And Before We Can Even Think About The Two Of Us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Ross: Okay. (He Leans In To Kiss Her Again, But She Leans Back Preventing Him From Making Contact.) Wow, Its-Its 5:30 In The Morning. (Rachel Laughs) So, Id better get cracking on this baby.
Rachel: Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.
Ross: Okay, Ill Be Up In, (Looks At The Letter) 18 Pages. Front And Back. Very Exciting. [Scene: The Beach House, The Next Morning. Ross Is Passed Out On The Kitchen Counter. He wakes up with a start and has one of the pages of the letter stuck to his face.]
Ross: Oh. (Looks At His Watch) Oh-Oh. (Takes A Drink Of Coffee And Resumes reading the letter)
Rachel: (Coming Down The Stairs) Hey! (Ross Jumps Up, And Quickly Puts The Letter Back Together, Pretending Like He Has Just Finished It.) What Happened To You? Why didnt you come up?
Ross: Done!
Rachel: You just finished?
Ross: Well, I Wanted To Be Thorough. I Mean This-This Is Clearly Very, Very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Rachel: So umm, does it?
Ross: Im sorry.
Rachel: Does it?
Ross: Does It? Does It? Yeah, I Wanted To Give That Whole Does It? part just another glance.
Rachel: What Are You Talking About, Ross, You Just Said That You Read It Twice! Look, Y'Know What, Either It Does Or It Doesnt, And If You Have To Even Think about it...
Ross: (Interrupting) No, Rach, No. I Dont, I Dont, I Dont Have To Think About It, In Fact, Ive Decided, Ive Decided That, That It.......Does. (Rachel Stands There For A Moment, Starting To Cry. Then Gasps And Runs Over And Hugs him. While hugging her, Ross tries to find the Does it? part in the letter.)
Rachel: Are you sure?
Ross: Oh, sure! Im sure.
Rachel: I Know. (Hugs Him More Violently This Time And Pushes Him Back Away From The Letter.) [Scene: The beach. Chandler and Monica are out getting some sun.]

Joey: Dont blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Chandler: Y'Know What, Hes Right. Theres Something Like Uh, Ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Monica: Well forget it! It doesnt hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
Joey: If You Want Some Privacy You Can Use My Hole. [Scene: The beach house, Phoebe is coming down the stairs all packed and ready to go.]

Chandler: Oh My God! If You Say That One More Time, Im Gonna Break up with you!
Ross: Fine! Fine! But This Break-Up Was Not All My Fault, And She, She Says Here, (Reading From The Letter) If You Accept Full Responsibility... (To Chandler And Joey) Full Responsibility! ...I Can Begin To Trust You Again. Does That seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!
Joey: No?
Chandler: Look, Ross, You Have What You Want, Youre Back With Rachel. If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Ross: (Calming Down) Yeah, I Know. I Mean, No, Youre Right. Yeah I Guess Ill let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Joey: Sure, Its Hard To Forget! But That Doesnt Mean You Have To Talk About It! A Lot Of Things Happened On That Trip That We Should Never, (To Chandler) ever talk about.
Ross: What the hell happened on that beach?!

Phoebe: (Reading From The Note) Good-Bye Phoebe And Ursula. Ill Miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!
Ursula: Well, Its Pretty Much The Gist. Well, Except For The Poem. You read the poem, right?
Phoebe: Noooo!!

Chandler: (Following Monica) We Were Two Miles From The House. Scared And Alone. We Didnt Think We Could Make It. (He Goes To Put His Hands On Monicas shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
Monica: I was in too much pain.
Joey: And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Chandler: And then Joey remembered something.
Joey: Id seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Ross: Wait A Minute! I Saw That! On The Discovery Channel, Yeah! About Jellyfish And How If You... (Stops Suddenly And Turns To Look At Monica) Ewwww!! You Peed on yourself?!
