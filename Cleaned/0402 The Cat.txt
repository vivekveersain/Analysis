Joey: What? Whats wrong?
Phoebe: I Just, I Just Have This Really Strong Feeling That This Cat Is My Mother.
Rachel: You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!

Rachel: Umm, When Were You Gonna Tell Me That Youre Going Out With Chip Matthews?
Monica: Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Rachel: Nooo! Its Not Okay! I Cant Believe You Would Want To After what he did to me!
Monica: What, that little thing at the prom?
Rachel: Monica! I Couldnt Find Him For Two Hours! He Was Having Sex With Amy Welch!
Monica: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Rachel: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Monica: Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Rachel: Okay, That Doesnt Help Me, Because We Went To The Same High school.
Monica: You Went To One Where You Were Popular, And You Got To Ride Off Chips Motorcycle, And Wear His Letterman Jacket. I Went To One Where I Wore A Band uniform they had to have specially made.
Rachel: (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
Monica: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Rachel: (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Monica: Back Then, I Thought That I Would Never, Ever Get The Chance To Go Out With A Chip Matthews, And Now Hes-Hes Called Me Up And Asked Me Out. And The fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Rachel: Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) 
Monica: Oh, really?!
Rachel: Yeah. Just, If Its Possible, Could You Leave Him Somewhere And Go have sex with another guy?
Monica: Ill Try. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, they are all there eating breakfast.]
Ross: So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Joey: Well, There Were A Couple Of Calls Last Night, But Ah, I Dont Think any of them are gonna work out.
Chandler: Yes, Joey Has A Very Careful Screening Process. Apparently, Not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Phoebe: (Is Struggling With The Cat) Stop It! Stop It! She Keeps Squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Ross: So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Phoebe: Well, Im Not Sure. I Mean, I Guess Until She Y'Know, Gets Used To The Fact That Theres Y'Know, A New Mom. Y'Know, I Think Shes Worried That Y'Know, Shes Gonna, Shes Gonna Be Replaced. (To The Cat, In A Funny Voice) Well, Thats Not Gonna Happen Is It? Noo. (Gets Up) Okay, I Have To Return A Call In the other room.
Monica: Why cant you use the phone in here?
Phoebe: Well, Im Returning A Call From A Certain Mom At The B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monicas room)
Ross: So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?
Monica: Ross, dont start.
Ross: Come On, You-You Cant Tell Me You Actually Believe That-That theres a woman inside that cat!
Rachel: I believe it.
Ross: No you dont. 
Rachel: Yes, I do.
Ross: No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.
Rachel: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Ross: I do not always have to beokay, okay. (starts to leave)
Rachel: Jurassic Park Could Happen. (Ross Wants To Say Something, But Just Smiles And Leaves.) [Scene: Chandler And Joey'S, Joey And Chandler Are Showing A Couple Of Guys (Tony And Peter) the entertainment center.]
Tony: Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
Joey: Pretty nice?
Chandler: Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Tony: We Dont Have 50 Bucks, But Would You Be Willing To Trade For It? Weve Got A Canoe. (Joey Jumps Up In Excitement And Without Turning Around Chandler Holds Out His Hand stopping him, and ushering him back into his seat. Joey sits down, dejected.)
Chandler: Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
Tony: You gotta take the canoe!
Chandler: All Right, Just, Just Take The Entertainment Center, And Then When You get home, throw the canoe away!
Peter: Were Not Throwing It Away! I Built That Canoe! (Starts To Leave As Tony chases after him)
Joey: (To Peter) Good For You!! [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Ross are there.]
Rachel: (Entering) You Guys, Youre Never Gonna Believe What I Just Found tacked up on a telephone pole! (Shes holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?
Ross: (Taking The Flyer) Apparently Phoebes Mother Also Goes By The Name Julio.
Rachel: You Guys, Theres A Little Girl In Soho Looking For This Cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Joey: (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Rachel: Do we have to tell her?
Ross: Yes, we have to tell her!
Monica: Oh, but its made her so happy.
Ross: (Holds Up A Hand) Little Girl Misses Her Cat. (Hold Up The Other Hand) Crazy Lady Thinks Her Mother Is In A Cat. (Gets Up) Okay, Y'Know What, I Have To Go Have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
All: (disappointed) Yeah.
Ross: Thank you.
