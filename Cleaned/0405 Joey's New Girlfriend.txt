Ross: Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)
Rachel: What was that?
Ross: Monica knows.
Monica: It'S This Dumb Thing That Ross Made Up `Cause He Was Trying To Fool Our Parents. It'S A Way Of Giving The Finger, Without Actually Having To Give It. I Remember I Cried The Night You Made It Up, `Cause It Was The First Time That I Realized That I Was actually cooler than my older brother.
Ross: Well, I'M Gonna Go Get Ready, (Gives Monica The Fist Thing.) For My Date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
