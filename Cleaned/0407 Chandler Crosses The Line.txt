 [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Everyone Except Joey And Chandler Are There Eating breakfast.]
Chandler: (Entering In A Bathrobe) I Just Walked In The Bathroom And Saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Ross: Y'Know If We Ever Go To War And Youre Captured, Youre In For A big surprise.
Chandler: It Just Keeps Getting Worse And Worse! Y'Know? I Mean Its Bad Enough That Im In Love With My Roommates Girlfriendwhich By The Way, I Think She Knows. Because Every Time Were In The Room Together Theres This Weird Like Energy Between Us. And Call Me Crazy, But I Think She Likes Me Too. And Now I Have Seen Her Naked. I Mean At Least When Ive Seen Her With Clothes On, I Could Imagine Her Body Was Like Covered In Boles Or Something. But There Are No Boles, Shes Smooth! Smooth! (Leaves) (Pause)
Phoebe: Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
All: Yeah! Oh My God! Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, Joey Is Getting A Phone Number From A Woman (Casey) As Chandler watches from the doorway.]
Casey: Here you go.
Joey: Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
Casey: Great! (leaves)
Chandler: (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Joey: That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
Chandler: Goin Out, Huh? Wow! Wow! (Does A Little Celebration Dance) So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Joey: No, Things Are Fine With Kathy. Im Having A Late Dinner With Her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Chandler: (shocked) What?
Joey: Yeah-Yeah. And The Craziest Thing Is That I Just Ate A Whole Pizza By myself! (Laughs)
Chandler: Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Joey: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Chandler: Well, Im Upsetfor You. I Mean, Having Sex With An Endless Line Of Beautiful Women Must Be Very Unfulfilling For You. (He Cant Believe He Just sad that.)
Joey: What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
Chandler: Look, Joey, Kathy Is Clearly Not Fulfilling Your Emotional Needs. But Casey, I Mean Granted I Only Saw The Back Of Her Head, But I Got This Sense That shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
Joey: You got all that from the back of her head?
Chandler: All Right Look, I Think Its Time For You To Settle Down. Y'Know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Joey: Whos Elaine? [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Ross And Monica Are Sitting On The Couch Playing Cards, and Phoebe is working on a new song.]
Phoebe: (Singing) "Little, Tiny Tarzan, Swinging On A Nose Hair. Swinging With The Greatest Of Ease" Darn It! Now, I Dont Know Who To get to the next verse.
Ross: Oh, You Could Just Go Uh, "Greatest Of Ease (Plays Air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Phoebe: Yeah, Ooh, I Like That! Yeah. Wait! How Do You Know About bah-bah-bha-bhan?
Ross: Well umm, yknow, I used to play.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, thats right, the keyboards, huh?
Ross: Yeah, Just A Little In High School, But Then I Really Got Into It In College. I Mean Thats-Thats When I Really Found My Sound. (Monica is taking a drink as Ross says that, laughs, and snorts her drink.)
Monica: Oh God! Orange Juice Just Came Out Of My Nose, But It Was Totally Worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: He Used To Lock Himself In The Basement For Hours. No One Was Every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Phoebe: I wanna hear "The Sound."
Ross: Really? No. I Mean, Nah, I Havent Played In So Long, And-And, Well its-its really personal stuff, yknow?

Over The Background Music He Plays The Sound Of A Barking Dog, A Mooing Cow, A Laser Beam, Someone Coughing, A Jackhammer, A Doorbell, A Police Siren, A Ray Gun, Breaking Dishes, and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash.
