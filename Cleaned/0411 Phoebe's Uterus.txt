Phoebe Sr: Hey! Okay! Well Thanks For Coming Out To See Me. I Just-I Just Thought It Would Be A Very Good Idea To Talk About This Baby Stuff In Person. Yknow
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe Sr: I really dont think its a very good idea, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Why not?
Phoebe Sr: Well, Because Youd Be Giving Up A Baby, And I-I Really Donti Dont Know If Theres Anything I Can Say That Could Make You Understand The Pain Of Giving Up A Baby. So, Umm, (Picks Up A Puppy In The Box Next To The couch.)
Phoebe: Oh No! No-No! I Understand The Pain! Dont-Dont Hurt The puppy.
Phoebe Sr: No-no-no, the-the puppys yours.
Phoebe: Oh, I get a puppy!!
Phoebe Sr: Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Phoebe: Why?
Phoebe Sr: I Realise I Dont Have Any Right To Start Get All Parenty On You And Everything Now, But Umm, (Sees That Phoebe Isnt Paying Attention And Is Busy Mimicking The Puppy.) Uhh Phoebe, Would You Please Look At Me And Not The Puppy, its very important. 
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe Sr: I Mean, I Know What Im Talking About. I Gave Up Two Babies, And I Only Wish I Had Someone There That Had Given Up Babies, That Could Tell Me How Terrible It Is To Give Up Babies. I Just Think That, It Would Be Something You Will Regret Every Single Day For The Rest Of Your Life. So, How Ever Hard It Is To Give Up This Puppy, It Would Be Like A Million Times Harder To Give Up A Child. (Phoebe Is Playing With The Puppy again, and not listening) I really shouldnt have given you the puppy first.
Phoebe: All Right, Im Sorry. [Scene: The Museums Worker Cafeteria, Joey Is Eating Lunch With The Rest Of The tour guides. Another tour guide tries to sit down in a seat Joey saved for Ross.]

Monica: (to Chandler) So, did you do it?
Chandler: Yes, yes, we had the sex.

Chandler: Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Monica: All Right Uh, The Important Thing Is To Take Your Time, You Want To Hit em all, and you mix em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
