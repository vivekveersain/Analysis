Chandler: Okay, She Is The Star Of The Play. And She Is My Girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Ross: People can hear you.
Chandler: I Know!! (The play starts.)
Chandler: Wow! She looks great. Doesnt she?
Ross: Yeah. (Onstage Theres A Knock On The Door And Kathy Opens It. We Dont See whats going on, only hear it.) 
Kathy's Co-Star: Hi!
Kathy: Hi!
Ross: That is one good looking man!
Chandler: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Kathy's Co-Star: Sooo, youve been doing this long?
Kathy: No, Youre My First. Put The Money On The Table. (Ross And Chandler Have Stunned Looks On Their Faces As Kathy And Her Co-Star Start making out.)
Kathy'S Co-Star: Oh, Yeah! Ooh, Thats Nice. (They Start Making Out harder.)
Ross: Dude!
Kathy's Co-Star: Is that an expensive blouse?
Kathy: If You Want It To Be.  (Kathys Co-Star Rips Her Blouse Off And Buttons Go Flying Into The Audience, And one hits Ross. Chandlers mouth is on the floor.)
Ross: Heres Your Girlfriends Button. (Holding The Button.) Opening Credits [Scene: Chandler And Joey'S, Erm, Monica And Rachel'S, Monica Is Still Unpacking After the move, and Phoebe is their also.]
Phoebe: Oh, Hey, Mon, Do You Still Have Your Like Old Blouses And Dresses From high school?
Monica: Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? 
Phoebe: Well, Its Just That Maternity Clothes Are So Expensive. (Rachel enters)
Monica: Hey, Rach! I Made A Pile Of Your Stuff Over On This Side Of The Room. If You Could Just(Rachel Grunts And Throws Her Purse At It)Throw Your Purses At it.
Rachel: Bloomingdales eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
Monica: Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Rachel: No, But They Stuck Me In Personal Shopping. Which Is Just A Huge step down!
Phoebe: Personal Shopping? What Is That? Like Where You Walk Around With Snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: That sounds great!
Joey: (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
Monica: Umm, Excuse Me, We Switched Apartments. You Cant Eat Are Food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Joey: (Holding a turkey leg) Theres gravy?
Monica: If You Have The Big Apartment You Have To Deal With People Coming Over All The Time. That Fridge Has Got To Be Stocked, Okay, Thats Your Department Now. (She Takes Back The Turkey Leg) (Joey climbs up on the counter and starts looking at the top of the cabinets.)
Monica: What are you doing?
Joey: I Think I Left A Donut Up Here. [Scene: Central Perk, Ross And Chandler Are Entering After The Play. Phoebe And Joey are already there.]
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Ooh! How was Kathys play?
Ross: Well, Kathy Gets Half-Naked And Simulates Sex With A Real Good lookin guy.
Chandler: Yeah, Its Like Someone Literally Wrote Down My Worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Phoebe: Thats a good idea for a business!
Chandler: Im Totally Screwed. Okay, They Are Gonna Be Hot And Heavy On Stage Every Night, And Then Theyre Gonna Go To Their Cast Parties And Hes Gonna Try To Undermine Me. Y'Know Itll Be Like, "So Wheres Your Boyfriend, Whats-His-Name, Chester?" And Shell Go, "No-No-No, its Chandler." And hell go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Joey: (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
Chandler: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Joey: Chandler, Look Theyre Actors. Theyre There To Do A Job, Just Cause They Work Together, Doesnt Mean Theyre Gonna Get Together. I Mean Just Cause It Happened With Susan Sarandon And Tim Robbins, It Doesnt Mean its gonna happen with them.
Ross: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Joey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Ross: Theyre not a couple!
Phoebe: Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Joey: Okay Look, Look, Let Me Ask You A Question, When They Were Doing It On stage, was it like really hot?
Ross: Oh yeah!
Joey: Well Okay, So Then Youre Fine. The Rule Is When Two Actors Are Actually Doing It Off-Stage All The Sexual Tension Between Them Is Gone. Okay? So As Long As Its Hot Onstage You Got Nothing To Worry About. Its When The Heat Goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
Chandler: Really?
Joey: Look, You Guys Have Been To Every Play Ive Ever Been In, Have I Ever had chemistry on stage?
Ross: No.
Joey: Noooo!! [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Erm, Chandler And Joey'S, The Gang Minus Monica And Rachel are eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.]
Chandler: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Ross: Yknow What, I Dont Know How Comfortable I Am Going To See How hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Chandler: Yeah, I know but
Ross: Oh no-no-no, Im there.
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Monica: You made pancakes?
Joey: Yep! Grab a plate.
Monica: Okay. (She Does So And Starts To Walk Towards Joey To Receive Her pancakes.)
Joey: No-No, Stay Right There. (Monica Stops And Joey Flips Her A Pancake, Which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin closer.
Chandler: Okay, Okay, But Dont Worry, Because We Also Have Cereals, Muffins, Waffles, And, Jams, Jellies, And Marmalades. Which Im Fairly Certain are the same thing.
Joey: Listen Also Were Uh, Were Watching The Game Here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Ross: Oh yeah!
Monica: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Joey: Oh yeah, whos playing?
Monica: The players.
Ross: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Monica: (laughs) Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Joey: All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Phoebe: Oh. (Joey Flips The Pancake And Phoebe Catches It And Throws It On Her Plate.) [Scene: Bloomingdales, Rachels new job.]

(Pause) Yes I Am! (Pause) Yes I Am! Yes I Am! Yes I Am! Yes I Am! Yes I Am! Okay Bye, Call Me When You Get This Message. (Hangs Up As Her Boss, Mr. Waltham, Walks In.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I Ah really need to talk to you.
Mr. Waltham: In A Moment, Please, Im In The Middle Of A Task. And You Have A Customer.  (Its A Really Good-Looking Man, Joshua, That Rachel Has An Instant Crush On. Well Actually Its Tate Donovan, So Its Not Like Shes Really Testing Her acting skills.)
Rachel: Hi!
Joshua: Hi, Im Joshua.
Rachel: Hi, Im Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Joshua: Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife
Rachel: Oh, Im So Sorry. (He Walks Over To Look And Some Clothes And Rachel Quickly Turns Around And Adjusts Her bra, trying to show off her assets.)
Joshua: Anyway, She Burned All Of My Clothes. I Got Away With Two Things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Rachel: Well, at least thats a great suit.
Joshua: Yeah, But It Wasnt Much Fun Dropping It Off At The Dry Cleaners In The Skirt. (Rachel Laughs) So I Need Everything Down To Underwear, So If Youre willing, Im all yours.
Rachel: Okay.
Mr. Waltham: Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Rachel: No-No, That Wasnt Me! (To Joshua) Well, We Should Get Started. Let Me Show You My Underwear. (Joshua Turns At That) The Selection Of Underwear We Carry. (He walks out and Rachel stares at his butt as he leaves. He makes a wrong turn.)
Rachel: Oh-Oh, Sorry, Its This Way, Its This Way. (Motions To The correct way.)
Joshua: Its This Way? Sorry. (He Walks Past Her And She Again Admires His Butt.) [Scene: Kathys Play, Ross And Chandler Are Waiting For Her In The Lobby After The play.]
Chandler: Im Right! Right? There Was Like No Chemistry Between Them. Before They Had Heat, And Now Theres No Heat! Now You Know What This Means, Joey told us what this means!
Ross: All Right, Lets Not Jump To Any Conclusions. All Right? There Was some sexual chemistry between them.
Chandler: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!

Kathy: Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank You So Much For Coming Again. Did You Like It tonight?
Ross: Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)
Kathy: Wasnt Nick Funny When He Couldnt Get His Match Lit? (Chandler laughs without opening his mouth.)
Kathy: Its A Good Play, Isnt It? (Chandler mumbles something, and Ross tells him to "Come on.")
Chandler: Oh, I Loved The Play. You Were Great, And Nick Ditto. Clearly youre having sex with him.
Ross: Okay, I (Walks away.)
Kathy: Clearly, Im having sex with him?
Chandler: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Kathy: Okay, So Let Me Just Get This Straight. Youre Accusing Me Of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Chandler: Yknow, I-I Could See How This Could Happen, Y'Know Youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.
Kathy: Acting! Chandler, This Is My Job! Im-Im Playing A Part In A play! How can you not trust me?!
Chandler: Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Kathy: Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face.
Chandler: Well, That Is What Happened, And I Dont Even See You Denying this!
Kathy: Ill Tell You What, Chandler, Why Dont You Call Me When You grow up!
Chandler: Yeah, Well, Dont Expect That To Happen Anytime Soon! Commercial Break [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Erm, Chandler And Joey'S, Joey, Phoebe, And Ross Are There eating pizza as Rachel enters.]
Rachel: I Have The Best Job In The Entire World! The Most Adorable Guy Came Over today, and I got to dress him up all day!

Monica: Im The Hostess! Not Those Guys! Im Always The Hostess! I Mean, I Was Always The Hostess, I Mean Even When I Was Little, I Mean The Girls Brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
