Janice: Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Chandler: Yes, I-I Know That You Do, But I Think One Of The Reasons People Were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Janice: Oh, Look At Us! Who Wouldve Thought That Cupid Had A Station At 14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)

Janice: Ugh, Well I Will Just Have To Soak Up Every Once Of Chandler Bing Until that moment comes.
Chandler: But I Do Know That Its Some Time Tomorrow. [Scene: Chandler And Joey'S Erm, Monica And Rachel'S, Phoebe And Monica Are Plugging In a bunch of electronics.]
Monica: Done?
Phoebe: Yep!
Rachel: (entering, with Joey) Hey!
Joey: Hey! Whats up?
Monica: This Switch Thing Has Been Driving Me Crazy. So I Turned It Off And Checked Every Outlet. Now, Four Of Them Dont Work. Which Means, One Of Them Has To Be Controlled By The Switch. So, I Plugged In Things In All Four Of The Outlets That-That Make Noise, So That Way, When I Turn It On I Just Follow The Noise And Find Out which one it is.
Joey: (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Rachel: Yknow, You-You Also Couldve Used Uh, Lamps And Then followed the light.
Monica: Yeah, Well, Im Using Noise. Okay. All Right! So, Is Everybody Ready? Here We Go. (She Flips On The Switch And A Hum Starts.) I Hear Something! I Hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises its Joey.)

Janice: Ohh, Well When You Said All You Were Going To Be Doing Between Now And the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you?
Chandler: Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Joey: Hey-hey, whats going on?
Chandler: Oh, Im Packing. Yknow Im-Im Packing cause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Joey: Thanks For Telling Me! (Janice runs into the bedroom.)
Chandler: Im Only Going To Pretend Im Moving To Yemen, Its The only way I can get rid off her.

Chandler: (from his bedroom) Thanks!
Ross: Look, Dont Worry About Me. Okay? Ill Just Stay Real Energetic And Stay Away From The Ball. Ill Uh, Ill Be That Guy Right Out Of The Circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
All: Oh!
Rachel: Oh, Well Maybe There Was A Dog Lookin At Him. (Ross Turns And Wants To Attack Rachel, But Joey Stops Him.) Commercial Break [Scene: The Park, Everyone Is Warming Up For The Rugby Game. Only Joey And Phoebe Came to support Ross.]

Emily: (To Ross) Good Luck, Babe. (The scrum forms and the game is underway.)
Liam: Ross! Ross! Come On! Get In Here! (Ross Gets Pumped Up.) Ross! Come On! (Ross Walks Over To The Scrum, Walks Around A Bit Looking For A Way To Get Into The scrum.)
Liam: Ross, Come On! Get In The Bloody Scrum! Ross, Get In! (Ross, Urged On By His Team-Mates, Jumps On Top Of The Scrum And Falls Headfirst Into the middle, leaving his feet sticking straight up.)

Monica: No-No-No, No! (Rachel Rips Off Another One, Revealing Another Hole. Rachel Then Moves Onto A Third one, but this one doesnt have a hole underneath it.)
Monica: I Know That Theres No Hole There, I Just Really Liked That Picture. (Rachel Looks At It And Then Throws It Away. She Then Removes A Fourth One, Revealing A third hole.)
Rachel: Oh my God! Look at this!
Monica: Okay, But There Is A Wire Back There! I Mean That Switch Is connected to something!
Rachel: I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Monica: I Just Thought That If I Could Follow The Wire I Could Find Out What It did.
Rachel: And did you?!
Monica: No. It Disappears Back There Behind That Baseboard. For A Minute There, I Thought It Went Downstairs. (Rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and gasps.)
Monica: But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Rachel: Oh my God.
Mrs. Chatracus: Hello darling.

Monica: All Right. The Super Couldnt Figure Out What It Did. A $200 An Hour Electrician Couldnt Figure Out What It Did. Ive Had Seven Pretty Serious shocks. I officially give up.
Rachel: Thank God.
Monica: I Guess Joey Was Right, It Does Nothing. [Cut To Chandler And Joeys, Joey And Phoebe Are Watching Tv. The Tv Is Turning Off And On, And Each Time Phoebe Is Blinking Her Eyes Like The Genie Did. The Switch obviously controls the outlet which the TV is plugged into.]
