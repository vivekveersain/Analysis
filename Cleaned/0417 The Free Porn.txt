Mr. Treeger: Yeah, It Happened To Me Once. I Was Just Flipping Through The channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Chandler: Like finding money with naked people on it!
Mr. Treeger: Then I Made The Mistake Of Turning Off The Tv, I Never Got It Back again. And Im sad. (Exits.)
Joey: (To Chandler) Why Would He Turn Off The Tv? (Chandler Shrugs.) Opening Credits [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S Erm, Chandler And Joey'S, Later That Morning. The Porn Is Still On, There Are Three Women Getting Ready To Shave The Chest Of Some Guy.

Rachel: All Right, Yknow What, Come On, Do We Really Have To Watch This while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)

Joey and Chandler: (stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!
Chandler: We dont know what could make this go away.
Joey: Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Chandler: And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey: Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Monica: Well at least, Im going to mute it.

Joey And Chandler: Oh No-No-No! (Monica Mutes The Tv And They Tentatively Look behind them)
Chandler: We still have porn.
Joey: Hey.

Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: Ohh, Im Getting Too Pregnant For This, Lugging Around A Stupid Massage Table. Yknow, I Have To Find A Job Where I Carrying A Smaller Table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)
Chandler: Or a job where you dont have to carry a table.

Monica: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross: (Thinks about it.) Nah.
Monica: Hey, cheer up! Youre gonna see her again, right?
Ross: Well I, Thats The Thing, I Dont Know! I Mean, Whenever I Brought It Up With Her She Said, (In A British Accent.) "This Is So Fantastic! Why Do we have to talk about the future? Lets just enjoy"
Monica: (Interrupting Him) No-No-No, Dont-Dont Do The Accent. Youve got to see her again.
Ross: And why do you care so much?
Monica: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?
Monica: No! Yknow, The Fantasy! Meet Someone From A Strange Land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ross: Is That Why In Junior High You Were The Only One That Hung Out With That Ukrainian kid?
Monica: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ross: Ahh.
Monica: Do you love her?
Ross: We said it was only going to be two weeks, yknow?
Monica: You love her!
Ross: What-what is love really?

Emily: I Wish I Could Know If Youd Heard Any Of That. I Suppose Ive Either Just Told You I Love You Or Given My Neighbours A Good Laugh. Mrs. Newman If Youre Listening, Bugger Off This In None Of Your Business. I Suppose Theres Not Much Chance You Did Heard That, And Theres The Call Waiting So, I Should Go. Oh well.
