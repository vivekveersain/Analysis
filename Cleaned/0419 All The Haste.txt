Chandler: Those were like the best seats ever.
Joey: Oh Yeah. Hey! Should We Give These Shirts To The Girls? Yknow, Kinda like a peace offering.
Chandler: Oh Yeah, Thats Very Nice. Plus, Yknow They Were Free And Theyre Too Small. (He Knocks On The Girls Door And Walks In. Surprise! The Girls, Obviously Using Star Trek Technology, Have Completely Moved Everything In Both Apartments Back To Their Original Positions, All In The Time It Took For The Guys To Go To A Basketball Game. Wow! Anyhoo, Chandler is stunned, and Joey doesnt even realise it.)
Chandler: Oh. Oh, God! (He Starts Running Around Like A Chicken With His Head cut off.)
Joey: Hey, Want A Beer? (Hands Him A Beer And Sits Down In One Of The Chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!
Chandler: I Know!!! (They both sprint to what used to be their apartment.)
Chandler: Open Up! Open Up! Open Up! (A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)
Monica: Well discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)
Chandler: What The Hell Is Going On?! (Its Rachels turn to open the door.)
Rachel: We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
Phoebe: (Opening The Door) I Had Nothing To Do With It. (Closes The Door.) (Opens The Door.) Okay, It Was My Idea, But I Dont Feel Good About It. (She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.)
Chandler: We are switching back, right now!
Monica: No, were not! Were not leaving!
Chandler: Well, Youre Gonna Have To Leave Sometime, Because You Both Have Jobs, And As Soon As You Do, Were Switching It Back! Theres Nothing You Can Do to stop us! Right, Joe?

Monica: Men are such idiots.
Rachel: Yeah! Can You Believe That Something That Stupid Actually Got Us Our apartment back?
Phoebe: Thats So Funny To Think If Youd Just Done That Right After the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Monica: Yeah, let-let-lets pretend thats not true.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: Okay, Scarfs Done. (Its Not Really A Scarf, Its Just A Bunch Of Yarn That Phoebe Has Tied Together. Just Then, Ross And Emily Enter Dragging With them Joey and Chandler.)

Ross: (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys
Rachel: Yeah, I-I Heard. (Pause, Everyone Looks At Each Other, Waiting For Rachels Reaction.) I Think Its Great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, Im So Happy For You! (Seeing Rachels Apparently Okay With This, The Rest Of The Gang Jumps Up To congratulate Ross and Emily on their pending nuptials.) 
Chandler: Oh, well, thats great!
