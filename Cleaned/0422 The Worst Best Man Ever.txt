Joey: If anything should happen to him
Ross: Joey! The vet said its a simple procedure.
Joey: So! Things Can Go Wrong! You Dont Know! What If He Doesnt Make it?!
Chandler: He will, Joe.
Joey: Yeah, But What If He Doesnt? Hes Such A Good Duck. (With That We Go Into A Little Flashback About The Guys Memories Of The Duck. The First One Is Joey Playing With Him In The Bathtub And Drying Him Off. Then Its Chandler Sitting On His Couch After They Moved Into The Girls Apartment, And Chandler Reading To Him In Bed, And Him Watching Baywatch When All They Had Was The Canoe And The Duck Was In A Bucket Of Water. Then We See Ross Eating Some Cereal And The Duck Watching Him. He Takes A Lamp And Moves The Duck Off Of The Table. Then Its Chandler Shooing Them Out Of The Bathroom In The Girls Apartment, Joey Revealing Their Disco Cubby Hole In The Entertainment-Center, Then Chandler Playing Hide-And-Go-Seek With Them, And Its Concluded With Various Scenes With The Duck Flapping Its Wings. And the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)
Joey: Im so worried about him, yknow?
The Doctor: (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?
Ross: Oh My God! Thank You! Thank You So Much! (He Grabs The Ring, Kisses It, and then does a double-take realising where its been.)
Joey: H-h-h-hows the duck?
The Doctor: Hes Doing Just Fine, Hes Resting Now, But You Can See him in a little bit.
Joey: Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Ross: No, thats all right.
Joey: No, Its Not. I Mean You-You Made Me Your Best Man And I Totally Let you down!
Chandler: Hey, come on, its not your fault.
Joey: Yeah, It Is! You Wouldnt Have Lost The Ring, Right? Yknow what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.
Chandler: No, you should.
Joey: Now, dont argue with me
