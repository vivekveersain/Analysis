Rachel: (interrupting) Still in love with?! 
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: Im not in love with Ross!
Phoebe: Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.

Phoebe: We thought you knew!
Rachel: We?!
Phoebe: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Rachel: You all know? Does Ross know?
Phoebe: Oh no, Ross doesnt know anything.
Rachel: Oh, I can not believe you didnt tell me!
Phoebe: Well, Because We Thought You Knew!! Its So Obvious! God, That Would Be Like Telling Monica, "Hey, You Like Things Clean." [Scene: A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]
Joey: Hey!
The Vendor: So, What Are You Guys In The Market For? Weve Got Uh, Scarves, tulip post cards...
Joey: Check This Out? Huh? (Joey Has This Big Tall Hat With A British Flag On the front of it.) Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
Chandler: Well, I Dont Have To Buy That, "Im With Stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Joey: Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)
Chandler: All Right, Look, Youre Not Really Gonna Buy That Are You? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Joey: Oh, I embarrass you? 
Chandler: How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
The Vendor: Hes Just Jealous. Youll Fit Right In; All Londoners Wear them!
Chandler: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
The Vendor: (looks around) Theyre all tourists.
Chandler: All Right, Look, If You Insist On Wearing That, In Public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Joey: Oh Yeah? (Puts The Hat On.) If Youre Gonna Make Me Choose Between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
The Vendor: Good choice.
Joey: Thanks.
Chandler: Okay, Wait. All Right, Thats It, Okay, Im Out Of Here. I Am Not Going To Be Embarrassed Anymore! (He Trips Over A Box, Falls Into A Flower Stand And Walks Away Trying To Be Cool.) [Scene: The hotel, Rosss room, Emily is entering.]

Emily: We dont have to.
Ross: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Emily: No. But, Monica And I Were Talking, And-And I Was So Upset About The Hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Ross: She said what?
Emily: She Said, "If Im Not Gonna Be Happy Getting Married Somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Ross: Postpone It? Emily, Do You Think Monica Realises How Much Our Parents Spent On This Wedding? Do You My Sisters Teeny-Tiny Little Brain Comprehends That People Took Time Out Of Their Lives To Fly Thousands Of Miles To Be Here, Huh? (He Puts his pants on backwards.) This isnt right.
Emily: I Realize That People Are Going To Be Disappointed. But, Im Sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
Ross: I Cant Ask People To Do That? Would You Ask People To Do That? (Holds out his pants)
Emily: Dont You Point Your Pants At Me! (She Throws Them On The Floor.) We Have No Choice! Anywhere Thats Half-Decent Wouldve Be Booked Months Ago, Ross dont you understand? This is our wedding Im talking about.
Ross: The Only Thing I Understand Is; Postponing It Is Not An Option. This Is when were getting married.
Emily: So what are you saying? Its now or never?
Ross: No. Im Saying Its Now. (He Starts Putting On His Pants, backwards again.)
Emily: Or?
Ross: Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Emily: Its Not The Pants. Its You That Is Backwards. And If, And If You Dont Understand How Important This Is To Me, Well Then, Perhaps We shouldnt get married at all! (She storms out.)

Monica: Sometimes we were.
Ross: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Monica: Okay.
Ross: Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
