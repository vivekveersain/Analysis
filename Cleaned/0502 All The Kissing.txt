Joey: Hey, It'S Me! I'M Comin' In! (Monica Quickly Dives Under The Water As Joey Enters. He Looks A Little Shocked At What Chandler's doing.)
Chandler: I've had a very long, hard day.
Joey: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Chandler: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Joey: Okay. (Joey turns to leave but stops at the door.)
Joey: You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Chandler: For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Joey: All Right! (Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)
Chandler: Are You Okay? I'M So Sorry, He Wouldn'T Leave. He Kept Asking Me About chicken.
Monica: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler: Hey Joe! (Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)
Chandler: Yeah, Can I Get A 3-Piece, Some Cole Slaw, Some Beans, And A Coke-(Yelps In  Pain As Monica Grabs Him Underwater)-Diet Coke. (Joey Gives Him A Thumbs Up And Heads For The Chicken.) Opening Credits [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are eating breakfast.]

Phoebe: I Have To Tell You This Story. Okay, I Was Coming Over Here And This driver

Ross: Ohh
Joey: Y'Know, I'D Walk Back To London For Another Frosty One Of Those Bad boys.
Ross: Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Joey: Later! (Exits.)
Ross: Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Monica: Yeah, But Her Plane Got Delayed In Athens. But Actually, (Checks Watch) she should be here by now.
Ross: Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Monica: No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Ross: Okay, I Did Not Abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily Showed Up At The Airport! I Had To Go After Her! I Mean, I-I Did What I Had To Do! She'S My Wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'knowEmily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Phoebe: So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Ross: No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Chandler: I can't believe she can out run you man!
Ross: Hey, She'S Fast!! Okay?!! (Chandler Is So Shocked At Ross'S Outburst That He Drops His Spoon And Backs Up) Oh! You-You Think You Can Be Beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
All: Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)
Ross: Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Rachel: Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Ross: That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Rachel: Terrible? Hell, I Was In Greece! That Was A Nice Hotel! Nice Beach, Met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)
Ross: So, what? That's it?
Rachel: Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ross: Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)
Rachel: Oh no, you're the best.
Ross: (Breaking The Hug) Ohh, I Gotta Go To The Flower Store! (Runs To The Door.) Check It Out, No One Will Tell Me Where Emily Is, So I'M Gonna Send 72 Long-Stem, Red Roses To Emily'S Parent'S House, One For Each Day That I'Ve Known And Loved Her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Chandler: Oh, Ross, When You Make Out Card; Be Sure To Make It Out To, Em-I-Ly. (Ross Bangs His Fists Together To Tell Chandler Off, Like What Was Learned Last Season. Read about it here.)
Monica: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Rachel: What?! I Didn'T Have A Good Time In Greece! Ross Abandoned Me! Okay, I Couldn'T Get A Plane Out, So I Had To Stay In Their Honeymoon Suite With People Coming Up To Me All The Time Going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, Why Are You Crying?" I Mean, It Was Sooo Humiliating. I Felt Like Such An Idiot! I Mean, It'S All My Fault! And You Know Why, because I make very bad decisions.
Chandler: Oh that's not true.
Rachel: Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Phoebe: London is stupid! Stupid!
Rachel: Phoebe, You Were Right. I Should'Ve Never Gone To London, And From Now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Phoebe: Oh No, I Did That For Someone Once And I'M Not Comfortable Having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Monica: I'll do it!
Rachel: That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Chandler: Okay, I Gotta Go To Work. (He Gets Up And Gives Monica A Rather Passionate Kiss As Rachel And Phoebe Look On In Amazement. After The Kiss Ends, Chandler Suddenly Realizes What He Just Did, So He Decides to do something rather rash.)
Chandler: And Uh, Rachel, Glad To Have You Back.  (He Goes Over And Gives Rachel The Same Treatment He Gave Monica, Only Rachel Is shocked.)
Chandler: Pheebs! (He Goes Over And Kisses Phoebe, Who Is Also Stunned.) Always A Pleasure. (And He Struts Out Leaving The Girls To Stare At Each Other.) [Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Chandler And Joey Are There Looking At Pictures from the trip to London.]
Monica: Oh, Rachel, Sweetie, Look, Here'S A Really Cute Picture Of Joey And You at the reception.
Rachel: Ohh, He'S Married! Ross Is Married. I Can'Ti Still Can'T Believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)
Monica: Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Rachel: I Mean, Y'Know I'M Just Gonna Have To Accept It (She Grabs The Rest Of the pictures)
Monica: Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)
Rachel: I mean it's my fault.
Monica: Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Rachel: Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)
Monica: Okay. That'S Okay. I-I Know That You'Re Very Upset Right Now. I Know, I know that wasn't about me.
Joey: (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.
Monica: If You Would Stop Thinking About Ross For One Minute You Would Notice That There Are Great Guys Everywhere! I Mean, Look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther Turns To listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Rachel: Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda
Monica: (Interrupting) Oh, What About That Guy Over There? (She Points At Another Guy And Gunther Is Deflated.) Remember? That Is The Guy You Flirted With At the counter that time.
Rachel: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Monica: You'Re Going To Talk To Him! Y'Know What? We Made A Deal, I Make Your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Rachel: All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Joey: Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey, Pheebs!
Monica: We Got Out Pictures Back From London. (Shows Her One.) Here'S All Of Us at the Tower of London.
Phoebe: (Grabs The Pictures) Oh! Here We All Are! Yeah, There'S Ross And Joey And You And Me. (She Picks Up A Magic Marker And Draws Herself In. Monica Can'T watch.)
Chandler: All Right, Y'Know What, We'Ve Been Talking About London Too Much haven't we?
Phoebe: No. I'M Sorry. It'S Just 'Cause I Couldn'T Be There. 'Cause All I Ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
All: Sorry. (Rachel returns.)
Monica: What happened?
Rachel: Well, Y'Know, A Little Of This, A Little Of That. Got Myself A Date tomorrow night.
Monica: See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Rachel: Well (Gunther Goes Up To The Guy And Holds A Sign That Reads, "We Reserve The Right To refuse service to anyone.")
Gunther: (To The Guy) Get Out! [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Chandler Enters To Find Monica Waiting Patiently For Him. He closes the door and they start kissing.]
Monica: What took you so long?
Chandler: I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Monica: Oh, Good.  (They Start Kissing And Turn Around So That Chandler Is Facing The Door. And Chandler sees Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey walk in and quickly ends the kiss with Monica.)
Chandler: So, Thanks For Having Me Over! Rach. (Goes Over, Grabs Her, And Kisses Her.) Pheebs. (After A Moment While He Decides How To Kiss Her Around Her Belly, Grabs Her and kisses her.)
Joey: (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!
Monica: Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Rachel: That's not European!
Phoebe: Well, It Felt French. (Joey Is Intrigued.) [Scene: The Hallway Between The Apartments, Rachel Is Returning From Her Date With Dave.]
Rachel: Oh God, I really had a good time!
Dave: Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.
Rachel: Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Dave: Yeah!
Rachel: Okay. Oh, Uh, Wait A Minute, Y'Know What? I Uh, I Can'T Decide This. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Dave: Okay, Yeah! (She Enters The Apartment, Leaving Dave In The Hallway, To Find Ross Sitting On The couch with a big box.)
Rachel: Umm, hi!
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Ross: She's doing her laundry.
Rachel: What's that? (Points to the box.)
Ross: It Came In The Mail Today, It'S Uh, 72 Long-Stemmed Red Roses, One For each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Rachel: Oh, honey that's awful.
Ross: Oh, It'S Not So Bad. Monica'S Gonna Make Potpourri! I Think I'M Gonna Go wander out in the rain for a while.
Rachel: But, it's not raining.
Ross: I can't catch a break!
Rachel: Y'Know What Ross? You'Re Not Going Anywhere. You'Re Gonna Sit Right Here. I'M Gonna Make You A Cup Of Tea And We'Re Gonna Talk This Thing Whole Out. All right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!
Dave: Yeah?
Rachel: Umm, Listen, I'M Gonna Need To Take A Rain Check, My Roommate Is Just Really Sick. Okay? Bye! (She Goes Back In To Talk To Ross.) Honey, Listen, I Know, I Know things seem so bad right now.
Monica: (Poking Her Head In) Rach? Can I Talk To For Just A Minute? I-I Dropped some socks.
Rachel: Yeah. (She Goes Out To Join Her In The Hall And Starts Looking For The dropped socks.)
Monica: What Is The Matter With You?! Do You Want To Fall Into The Trap? Do You want to fall into the trap?!
Rachel: Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Monica: I Just Ran Into Dave And He Told Me That You Blew Him Off! I Mean, You Listen To Me! Now, I'M Calling The Shots! I Say You Leave Ross Alone And Go Get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Rachel: Well, Ultimately, I Was Trying Y'Know, I-I Wantedtell Him Y'Know, that I'm still in love with him.
Monica: (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Rachel: Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Monica: I make the decisions, and I say no.
Rachel: Well, Y'Know What, No, You Do Not Make My Decisions Because Y'Know What, you're fired.
Monica: You Can'T Fire Me. I Make Your Decisions And I Say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Rachel: Well (At A Loss For Words, She Grabs Some Of Monica'S Laundry And Throws It On The Floor As A Diversion To Allow Rachel To Run Back Inside And Close The door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)
Monica: Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Joey: (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?
Monica: Rachel locked the door.
Joey: I'Ll Kick That Door In If You Give Me A Little Sugar. Commercial Break [Scene: The hallway, continued from earlier. Monica is still locked out.]
Monica: Rachel! Let Me In! Rachel! [Cut To Inside The Apartment, Ross Decides To Let Monica In And Goes Over And Opens The door in mid-pound.]
Monica: Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Rachel: No.
Monica: I really need to talk to you.
Rachel: Well, then talk!
Monica: Okay, I Will. Remember That Thing That We Just Discussed That You Wanted to do?
Rachel: Yes!
Ross: What thing?
Monica: Well, Rachel Wants To Take Swing Dance Lessons. Which I Think Is A Really Stupid Idea! It'S Dangerous, She'S Never Gonna Get What She Wants, And Who Knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.
Ross: Monica'S Right, Swing Dancing Can Be Tricky. I'M Gonna Use The Phone. I Gotta Cancel Those Five Giant Teddy Bears I Sent To Emily. (Looks At The Rose Mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.
Rachel: I'm gonna do it.
Monica: All Right, Rachel, I Know-I Know You Think I'M Crazy, Please, Before You Tell Him You Love Him, Just-Just Try To Find One Person Who Thinks This Is A Good Idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Rachel: But I

Joey: Yeah, all of us! All day!
Phoebe: That Sucks! That'S Not A Trip! I Just Came From The Park! What Are We Gonna High Five About At The Stupid Central Park? "Well, It'S Right By My House, All right!"
