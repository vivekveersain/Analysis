Chandler: So they're going on dates? When?
Joey: I think Saturday(groans in pain again).
Frank: (To Phoebe) What's with him?

Chandler: All Right. (Dr. Harad exits.)
Frank: It's not that weird, is it?
Phoebe: It'S Very Weird! I Don'T Want Some Guy Down There Telling Me, I'M y'know, dilatedamundo!
Ross: To be fair, he doesnt seem to be impersonating Fonzie
Phoebe: (Interrupting) What Are You Doing?!! Why Are You Defending Him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Ross: Again, It'S Not That He (Phoebe Fakes Pain To Get Ross Looking For Another Doctor.) [Scene: The waiting room, Chandler is looking for Monica.]

Chandler: Oh, Is This About You-You Dating The Nurse? Yeah, Joey Already Told Me, And I Am So-So Fine. I Mean, You And I We'Re Just, Y'Know, We'Re Nothing, We'Re goofin' around.
Monica: Umm, Actually I Was About To Tell You That I Was, I Was Going To Get Out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Chandler: Fine! Maybe I will too!
Joey: (Entering From The Elevator Caring Gifts For The Kids) Hey, You Guys! Look What I Found In The Giiiiiiift Shop. (He Doubles Over In Pain In Front An Old Man In A Wheel Chair.) Get Up! Get Up! Get Up! (The Old Man Waves Him Away.) [Scene: The Delivery Room, Ross Has Returned With Another Doctor. This One, Is Well, younger.]
Ross: Okay, Phoebe, This Dr. Oberman. He Has No Strong Feelings About Fonzie Or any of the Happy Days gang.
Phoebe: Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Dr. Oberman: Umm, I'M Actually A First Year Resident, But I Get That A Lot, You see, I-I graduated early
Phoebe: (Interrupting) Uh-Huh, Me Too. Ross, Maybe I Should'Ve Specified That I'd be needing a grown up doctor. 
Dr. Oberman: Oh no, I'm fully qualified to

Frank: Oh Cool! You Made Him Cry! [Scene: Another Hospital Room, Joey Has Now Been Admitted And His Doctor Is About To break the bad news to him, Monica, and Chandler.]
Joey's Doctor: Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Joey: Umm, well, what else could it be?
Joey's Doctor: It's kidney stones.
Joey: Or?
Joey'S Doctor: Kidney Stones! [Scene: The delivery room, Dr. Harad is back and checking on Phoebe.]
Dr. Harad: All Right, You'Re Getting There. Oh, And Y'Know, These Babies Are very, very lucky.
Phoebe: They are. Why?
Dr. Harad: They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Phoebe: Happy birthday!
Dr. Harad: Just-Just To Clarify, I'M Not Fonzie. (Phoebe Nods In Agreement As He leaves.)
Rachel: Honey, Y'Know I Just Gotta Tell You, I Think This Is Such A Terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Phoebe: I know, it is.
Rachel: Yeah!
Phoebe: Can I tell you a little secret?
Rachel: Yeah!
Phoebe: I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)
Rachel: Ohh, I'M Gonna Be On The News! Commercial Break [Scene: The delivery room, continued from earlier.]
Rachel: Okay, Phoebe, Honey, You Gotta Be Kidding. I Mean, You Know You cannot keep one of these babies!
Phoebe: Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Rachel: Yes! Yes! Yes, I Do! I Do Know! Frank And Alice Are Gonna Want To Keep All of their children!
Phoebe: Maybe Not! Y'Know? Seriously, Three Babies Are A Handful Maybe They'Re Y'Know, Looking For A Chance To Unload One Of Them. Listen, I-I Hate To Miss An opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Rachel: Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Phoebe: Oh, just ask him!
Rachel: Me?!
Phoebe: I Can'T Ask Him! Do You Have Any Idea How Inappropriate That would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Rachel: No! Forget It! I Am Not Gonna Ask Frank To Give You One Of His kids!!
Phoebe: You'Re Right.  (There's an awkward silence then suddenly Phoebe gets an idea.)
Phoebe: Tell Him It'S For You. [Scene: Joey's room, his doctor, Chandler, and Monica are there.]
Monica: Feeling a little better sweetie?
Joey: Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Monica: Me too.
Ross: (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Joey'S Doctor: Kidney Stones! Now, Ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, We Try To Break Up The Stones Up With Shock Waves, But They'Re To Close To The Bladder Now. Which Means We can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
Joey: (Interrupting) Whoa-Whoa! No-No-No-No-No, Nothing Is Going Up! Okay? Up, Up Is Not An Optionwhat'S A Urethra? (Monica Whispers What It Is In His Ear.) Are You Crazy?! [Scene: The delivery room, Rachel and Frank are there.]
Phoebe: (To Rachel) So did you ask him?
Rachel: No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Phoebe: Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Dr. Harad: (laughing) Oh Fonzie.
Rachel: Y'Know Who I Always Liked? Mork. (Dr. Harad drops what he's doing and stares at her.)
Phoebe: Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Dr. Harad: Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Rachel: Yeah, But Umm Yes, But, Fonzie Was Already Cool, So He Wasn'T hurt, right?
Dr. Harad: Yeah, that's right.

Dan: So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Monica: Great! (Dan leaves as Chandler enters.)
Chandler: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Monica: Well Uh, You And I Are Just Goofing Around, I Thought, Why Not Goof around with him.
Chandler: Y'Know, I Don'T Know If You'Ve Ever Looked Up The Term Goofing Around In The Dictionary Well, I Have, And The Technical Definition Is, Two Friends Who Care A Lot About Each Other And Have Amazing Sex And Just Wanna Spend More Time Together. But If You Have This New Fangled Dictionary That Gets You Made At Me, Then We Have To, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Monica: I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler: Really? Okay, so
Monica: (interrupting) Know when to stop.
Chandler: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Monica: Yeah. All Right, I'M Gonna Go Tell Dan That It'S Not Gonna Happen. (They Kiss And As She Starts To Leave, Chandler Starts To Dance. Without Turning Around.) Don'T do the dance.
Chandler: Right! [Scene: The Delivery Room, Everyone Except Rachel Is There. Phoebe, Monica, And Ross are holding the babies.]

All: Yeah, Sure Yeah. Yeah. (They hand her the babies and leave them alone.)
Phoebe: So, Here You Are. It Seems Like Yesterday I Was Talking To You In That Little Petri Dish. Everyone Said Labor Was The Hardest Thing I'D Ever Have To Do, But They Were Wrong This Is. Oh, I Had The Most Fun With You Guys! I Wish I Could Take You Home And See You Everyday. Okay, I'Ll Settle For Being Your Favorite Aunt. I Know Alice'S Sister Has A Pool, But You Lived In Me. Okay, So We'Re Cool. Yeah, We'Re Gonna Be Great. Little High Fives! (Imitates The High Fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One Of The Babies Begins To Cry.) Well, If You'Re Gonna Cry. (She Starts Crying.) Ending Credits [Scene: The Delivery Room, Everyone Is Hanging Out With Phoebe. Frank, Alice, And The kids aren't there.]
Monica: Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!

Phoebe: Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Chandler: So Uh, Now That Little Chandler Turned Out To Be A Girl, What Are They gonna name her?
