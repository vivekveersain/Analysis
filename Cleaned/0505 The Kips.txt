Monica: Well That'S Because You Always Sleep To Noon, Silly! This Is What 9 looks like.
Joey: I Guess I'Ll Get Washed Up Then. Watch That Sunrise. (He Goes Into The bathroom.)
Monica: I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Chandler: I Know, Me Too. Hey! Y'Know What If We Went Away For A Whole Weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Monica: All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Chandler: Yeah, I Can Say That I Have A Conference And You Can Say You Have A chef thing.

Monica: (Entering From Her Room) Hey, Guess What I'M Doing This Weekend! I'M going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Phoebe: Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Monica: Oh Now That-That-That'S Funny, It Seems Like Chandler'S Conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Chandler: I'M Not In Charge Of Where The Conference Is Held. Do You Want People to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.

Joey: Hey!
Monica: Hey.
Ross: Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Monica: No, she's out shopping.
Ross: Damn!
Chandler: What's going on?
Ross: I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Phoebe: Wait A Minute! So When Emily Comes You'Re Just, You'Re Not Gonna See Rachel anymore?
Ross: Well Look, I'M Just Trying To Focus On The "I Get To See My Wife," Part, All Right? And Not The Part That Makes Me Do This. (He Takes A Big Swig of Pepto Bismol.)
Monica: Wow, So You Guys Are, You'Re Never Gonna Be In The Same Room Together? How is that even gonna work?
Ross: I Have No Idea. I Mean But-But I Assure You I Will Figure It Out. (They all reflect briefly on what was said.)
Joey: Doesnt seem like it's going to work, I mean
Rachel: (entering) Hi, guys!
Joey: Hi!
Chandler: Uh, hey!
Rachel: What's going on?
Chandler: We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Joey: So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Phoebe: Yeah That'S Better Than My Way. (They all agree and head to Monica's room.)
Rachel: Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Chandler: Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
Rachel: (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Ross: So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Rachel: Oh Yeah! I Know. [Cut to Monica's bedroom, Chandler is trying to listen through the door.]
Phoebe: (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
Chandler: Oh Yes, Somebody Just Said, "Can You Hear Anything?" (Joey is bent over at the waist and is looking for something under Monica's bed.)
Monica: Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Joey: (Holding A Box) Well, Remember When They Got In That Big Fight And Broke Up And We Were All Stuck In Her With No Food Or Anything? Well, When Ross Said Rachel At the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Monica: Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
Phoebe: Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)
Chandler: Condoms?
Joey: You Don'T Know How Long We'Re Gonna Be In Here! We May Have To repopulate the Earth.
Chandler: And Condoms Are The Way To Do That? [Cut to the living room.]
Ross: Anyway It-It Kinda-It All Boils Down To This, The Last Time I Talked To Emily

Monica: Come Here. (He Does, And They Kiss.) Okay, Be Right Back.  (Goes To The Bathroom And Chandler Turns On The Tv And Finds A High-Speed Police chase.)
Chandler: Oh Yes! Monica, Get In Here! There'S A High-Speed Car Chase On! (Monica returns, carrying a glass.)
Monica: We're switching rooms.
Chandler: (Looks At What She'S Holding And Shies Away) Oh Dear God, They Gave Us glasses!
Monica: No, They Gave Us Glasses With Lipstick On Them! I Mean, If They Didn'T Change The Glasses, Who Knows What Else They Didn'T Change. (He Glares At Her.) Come On sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Chandler: Okay, But Let'S Do It Now Though, Because Chopper 5 Just Lost It'S Feed! (He Grabs Their Bags And Sprints Out.) [Scene: Central Perk, Ross is trying to tell Rachel about Emily's ultimatum again.]

Ross: Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Rachel: Yeah, I Know. It'S Ridiculous! I Can'T See You Either. [Scene: Chandler and Monica's weekend, a hotel clerk is showing them their new room.]
Hotel Clerk: I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Chandler: Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
Hotel Clerk: (watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left.
Chandler: Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Monica: We're switching rooms again.
Chandler: What? Why?
Monica: This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Hotel Clerk: Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Monica: (To Chandler) Excuse Me, Umm, Can I Talk To You Over Here For Just A second?
Chandler: Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
Monica: Chandler!
Chandler: (turning to face her) Yeah.
Monica: Look, These Clowns Are Trying To Take Us For A Ride And I'M Not Gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!

Monica: Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Chandler: Oh, Who Should I Blame? The Nice Bell Man Who Had To Drag Out Luggage to 10 different rooms?
Monica: I Don'T Know, How About The Idiot Who Thought He Could Drive From Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Chandler: Do not speak ill of the dead.
Monica: We'Re Supposed To Uh, Be Spending A Romantic Weekend Together, It-It, what is the matter with you?
