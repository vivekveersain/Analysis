Joey: Come on look guys, don't fight.
Ross: And The Reason I'M Doing This Is Because I Am Joey'S Friend. And If you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Chandler: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Ross: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Joey: Hey-Hey Guys, Hey! How About We Settle This Over A Friendly Game Of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
