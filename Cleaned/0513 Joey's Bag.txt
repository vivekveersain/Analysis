Monica: I Can'T Believe We'Ve Never Done This Before! It'S Sooo Good! So Good For Monica!  (Chandler picks up the timer being used and turns it to zero at which it chimes.)
Chandler: Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Monica: That was a half an hour?
Chandler: It'S Your Timer. (They change places.)
Monica: Y'Know, I Don'T Like To Brag About It, But I Give The Best massages!
Chandler: All Right, Then Massage Me Up Right Nice! (She Starts The Massage, Only She Is Doing Extremely Hard And Chandler Is Gasping In pain.)
Chandler: Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Monica: It's so good, isn't it?
Chandler: It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Monica: Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Chandler: Good-Bye Muscles!! Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch.]
Chandler: I'M Telling You, She Gives The Worst Massages Ever!! Okay, It Was Like She Was Torturing Me For Information. And I Wanted To Give It Up I Justi Didn'T Know what it was!
Joey: Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Chandler: Look, For The First Time In My Life I'M In A Real Relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Ross: (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.
Joey: Whoa, Dude, Look Out! You Almost Crushed My Hat! (He Picks A Hat Up From the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
Ross: Sorry.
Chandler: (Examining The Hat) And The Bunny Got Away. (Turns And Starts Looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
Ross: (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Joey: Oh! Yeah, Look There'S This Play All Right? And I'M Up For The Part Of This Real Cool Like Suave International Guy. A Real Clothes Horse. So I Figure That Everyone At The Audition Is Gonna Be Wearing This Kinda Y'Know, Ultra-Hip, High Fashion stuff.
Chandler: And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Joey: Yeah, Like You Could Find Something As Sophisticated As This. (Chandler picks up a basket from the table and puts it on his head.)
Chandler: Done.
Rachel: Joey, If You Wanna Look Good, Why Don'T You Just Come Down To The Store? I'll help you out.
Joey: Great! Thanks, Rach!
Rachel: Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!
Joey: All Right.  (Both of them remove their hats as Phoebe enters.) 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! Umm, Well, Only Okay Because I Just Got Back From, From The Hospital. (All at once.)
Rachel: What?
Ross: Is everything okay?
Joey: Are you all right?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Joey: Pheebs! Sorry!
Phoebe: It'S Okay, I Mean She Had A Really Incredible Life. And It'S Not Like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Rachel: Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?

Monica: (To The Guys) Not The Way They'Re Doing It. What, What Happened? How Did she die?
Phoebe: Well Umm, Okay We Were In The Market And She Bent Down To Get Some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Joey: Pheebs, I'm so sorry.

Joey: It looks like a women's purse.
Rachel: No Joey, Look. Trust Me, All The Men Are Wearing Them In The Spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.

Chandler: Pulling Flowers Out It Makes The Bag Look A Lot More Masculine. (Another man, an older man, enters, looking around and bumps into Chandler.)

Man: Oops, I'M Sorry. Excuse Me. Is This The Umm, The Memorial? (The gang moves off as Phoebe greets the new guest.)
Phoebe: Yeah, welcome.

So From Now On You Guys Are Gonna Have To Get Used To The Fact that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)
Phoebe: All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Rachel: Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Phoebe: Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Ross: Well, But Aren'T You Pissed At Him?! I Mean This Guy Abandoned You! I Gotta Tell You If This Were Me, This Guy Would Be In Some Serious Physical Danger! (Getting Worked Up) I Mean I-I-I'D Walk In There And I'D Be Like, "Yo, Dad! You And me outside right now!" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.
Monica: Well, at least you scared someone.
Phoebe: Y'Know It'S Funny, You'D Think I'D Be Angry. I Mean, You'D Think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Monica: Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. 
Phoebe: All Right. (She Goes Over And Tries To Give Phoebe A Massage. Phoebe Yelps In Pain And Jumps Away from her.)
Phoebe: Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Monica: What are you talking about?
Phoebe: As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Monica: (Indignant) I Give Good Massages! (Ross Laughs.) I Used To Give Them To Rachel All The Time Before She Got Allergic! And-And-And Chandler Loves Them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.)
Phoebe: (Seeing The Look On Chandler'S Face) He-He Does Not Like It! He Hates it! He's in pain!
Monica: No he's not!
Chandler: (wincing) Yes, he is!
Monica: What?!
Chandler: I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Monica: You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Ross: Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Monica: But The Minute We Start To Lie To Each Other (Pauses After She Realizes What She'S Saying.) And By 'We' I Mean Society. [Scene: Joey's audition, he is with bag.]
The Casting Director: Any time you're ready, Joey.

Chandler: Okay, but now see you're crying!
Monica: I'M Not Crying About That! I'M Crying About Something That Happened At work.
Chandler: What?
Monica: (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Chandler: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.

Chandler: Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Monica: I'm crying here!!
Chandler: Okay, Hear Me Out. Okay? You Give The Best Bad Massages. If Anybody Was Looking For The Best Bad Massage And They Were Thinking To Themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
