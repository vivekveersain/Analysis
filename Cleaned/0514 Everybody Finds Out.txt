 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is eating some Chinese food.]
Phoebe: (Looking Out The Window) Oh Hey, You Guys, Look! Ugly Naked Guy Is Putting Stuff In Boxes! (They all run and join her at the window.)
Rachel: I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Ross: Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Rachel: Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Chandler: And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Ross: Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
All: Good idea! Yes!
Ross: It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Joey: Hey, Yeah! Then We Could Do That Telephone Thing! Y'Know, You Have A Can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Chandler: Or We Can Do The Actual Telephone Thing. Opening Credits [Scene: Ugly Naked Guy'S Apartment, Ross, Rachel, And Phoebe Are Checking Out The place. Luckily, Ugly Naked Guy is nowhere to be seen.]
Ross: Oh My God! I Love This Apartment! Isn'T It Perfect?! I Can'T Believe I never realized how great it is!
Rachel: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Phoebe: It'S Amazing! You Better Hurry Up And Fill Out An Application Or I'M gonna beat you to it.
Ross: (Laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe Takes A Couple Of Steps To The Door And Ross quickly hurries out.)
Rachel: Well, I Never Thought I'D Say This, But I'M Gonna Go Use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)
Phoebe: (Looking Out The Window) Oh, Look! There'S Monica And Chandler! (Starts Yelling.) Hey! Hey, You Guys! Hey! (Chandler And Monica Start Taking Each Other'S Clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Rachel: Oh my God!
Phoebe: CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!

Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe: OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!

Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!

Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe: YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel: Yes, I Know! And Joey Knows! But Ross Doesn'T Know So You Have To Stop screaming!!
Ross: (entering) What's going on?

Phoebe and Rachel: Ohhh!!!
Rachel: (Trying To Divert His Attention From The Window By Jumping Up And Down) HI!! Hi! 
Ross: What?! What?!
Rachel: Nothing! Oh God, We'Re Just So Excited That You Want To Get This apartment!
Ross: Actually, It Looks Really Good. (Turns Towards The Window And Now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Phoebe: (Screaming Incoherently.) Get In Here!!! (Motions To Join Her And Rachel.) (Ross Starts Jumping And Screaming Incoherently And Hops Over And Joins In On The Group Hug.)  [Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there talking about Chandler and Monica.]
Phoebe: You Mean Whenever Monica And Chandler Where Like Y'Know Doing Laundry Or Going Grocery Shopping Oroh! All That Time Monica Spent On The Phone With Sad Linda from camp!
Rachel: Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Phoebe: Oh! Oh, I Can'T Believe It! I Mean I Think It'S Great! For Him. She might be able to do better.
Joey: (entering) Hey guys!
Rachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!
Joey: What? What?
Rachel: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Joey: You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
Rachel: No. Joey, She Knows! We Were At Ugly Naked Guy'S Apartment And We Saw Them Doing It Through The Window. (Joey Gasps) Actually, We Saw Them Doing It Up Against the window.
Phoebe: Okay, So Now They Know That You Know And They Don'T Know That Rachel knows?
Joey: Yes, But Y'Know What? It Doesn'T Matter Who Knows What. Now, Enough Of Us Know That We Can Just Tell Them That We Know! Then All The Lying And The Secrets Would finally be over!
Phoebe: Or, We Could Not Tell Them We Know And Have A Little Fun Of Our own.
Rachel: Wh-what do you mean?
Phoebe: Well Y'Know Every Time That They Say That Like They'Re Doing Laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Rachel: Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Joey: No-No-No! No-No Wait Rach, You Know What Would Even Be More Fun? Telling them.
Rachel: Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Joey: I can't take any
Phoebe: No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Joey: Noo! I Can'T Take Any More Secrets! (To Rachel) I'Ve Got Your Secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Rachel: You don't have any secrets!
Joey: Oh Yeah? Well, You Don'T Know About Hugsy, My Bedtime Penguin Pal. (Joey shies away.)
Rachel: (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Joey: Ugh.
Phoebe: Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: And Then. I Would Use Y'Know The Strongest Tool At My Disposal. My sexuality.
Chandler: (entering) Hello children!
All: Hey!
Phoebe: Okay, Watch, Learn, And Don'T Eat My Cookie. (She gets up and goes over to Chandler who's ordering some coffee from Gunther.)
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Chandler: Really?
Phoebe: (Feels His Arm) Yeah The Material Feels So Softhello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Chandler: Well, I Try To Y'Know, Squeeze Things. (Phoebe Giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
Phoebe: Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh! I can't tell you this.
Chandler: Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Phoebe: Well Actually You'Re The One Person I Can'T Tell This Too. And The One person I want to the most.
Chandler: What's going on?
Phoebe: I Think It'S Just Y'Know That I Haven'T Been With A Guy In So Long And How Sometimes You'Re Looking For Something And You Just Dont Even See That It'S Right There In Front Of You Sipping Coffeeoh No, Have I Said To Much? Well It'S Just Something To Think About. I Know I Will. (She Makes A Show Of Bending Over To Get Her Coat And Showing Off Her Bum. She Then Walks Out, Leaving No One To Eat Her Cookie.) [Scene: Chandler'S Bedroom, Chandler And Monica Are There, Of Course. Like Who Else would it be, duh!]
Monica: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Chandler: Well, My Grandfather Was Swedish And My Grandmother Was Actually A tiny little bunny.
Monica: Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Chandler: Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Monica: What?
Chandler: The Weirdest Thing Happened At The Coffee House, I Think, I Think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Monica: What are you talking about?
Chandler: I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Monica: That's not possible!
Chandler: Ow!
Monica: I'M Sorry It'S Just, Phoebe Just Always Thought You Were, You Were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Chandler: Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Monica: I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Chandler: No, I Didn'T Misunderstand, Okay? She Was All Over Me! She Touched My bicep for crying out loud!
Monica: This bicep?
Chandler: Well It'S Not Flexed Right Now! [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, And Chandler Are There. Monica Is entering from her room.]
Rachel: Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Monica: Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Rachel: Oh.
Monica: Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Chandler: Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Okay Great, Hold On A Sec! (She Runs To Her Room And Returns Carrying A Huge Bag Of Laundry.) Oh, Here You Go! You Don'T Mind Do Ya? That Would Really Help Me Out a lot! Thanks!
Monica: I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Phoebe: I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Ross: Well, I Called Over There And It Turns Out Ugly Naked Guy Is Subletting It himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Rachel: Oh.
Ross: No-No, I Got The Edge. I Know It'S Not Exactly Ethical But I Sent Him A Little Bribe To  Tip The Scales In My Direction. Check It Out, You Can Probably See It From The Window. (They all head to the window.)
Monica: Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Ross: No.
Chandler: That new mountain bike?
Ross: No.
Monica: Well what did you send?
Ross: A basket of mini-muffins.
Phoebe: But There'S A Whole Table Of Mini-Muffin Baskets. Which One Did You send?
Ross: The small one.
Rachel: What?! You-You Actually Thought That Basket Was Gonna Get You The apartment?
Ross: Well Yeah! Someone Sent Us A Basket At Work Once And People Went Crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Chandler: Your work makes me sad.
Ross: Oh Man! I Want That Place So Much!! I Was So Sure That Was Gonna Work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)
Rachel: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica: Bye!
All: Bye!
Phoebe: Bye Chandler! (She Walks Up To Him.) (Quietly.) I Miss You Already. (She pinches his butt.)
Chandler: (After They'Ve Left) Okay, Did You See That?! With The Inappropriate and the pinching!!
Monica: Actually, I did!
Chandler: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Chandler: Are you serious?
Monica: Phoebe Knows And She'S Just Trying To Freak Us Out! That'S The Only explanation for it!

Joey: Well I didn't tell them!
Monica: Them?! Who's them?
Joey: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Monica: Joey!
Joey: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Chandler: Oh man!
Joey: I'M Sorry! But Hey, It'S Over Now, Right? Because You Can Tell Them That you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Monica: Unless
Joey: No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Monica: Oh Man, They Think They Are So Slick Messing With Us! But See they don't know that we know that they know! So
Chandler: Ahh Yes, The Messers Become The Messies! [Scene: Monica And Rachel'S, Ross Is Looking At Ugly Naked Guy'S Apartment Through binoculars.]
Ross: Noooo.
Rachel: Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Phoebe: Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Ross: Look I'Ve Already Looked At Like A Thousand Apartments This Month And None of them even compares to that one!
Rachel: Y'know what you should do?
Ross: Huh?
Rachel: You Should Find Out What His Hobbies Are And Then Use That To Bond With Him. Yeah! Like If I Would Strike Up A Conversation About Say Umm, Sandwiches. Or Uh, Or my underwear.
Joey: I'm listening.
Rachel: (To Ross) See?
Ross: That Is A Great Idea! And! I Know Ugly Naked Guy Because We'Ve Been Watching Him For Like Five Years So That Gives Me Back My Edge! Oh, Let'S See Now he had the trampoline.
Phoebe: He broke that.
Ross: Well, he had gravity boots.
Rachel: Yeah, he broke those too.
Joey: So he likes to break stuff.
Ross: Okay, I'Ve Got To Go Pick Up Ben But I-I Will Figure Something Out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Phoebe: I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Joey: Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Ross: Right. (Exits.) (The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)
Rachel: Hello! (Listens) Oh Yeah! Hey! Hold On A Second She'S Right Here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.
