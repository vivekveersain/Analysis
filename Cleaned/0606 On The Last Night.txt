Monica: Because its my apartment!
Rachel: Well its mine too! What else you got?!

Chandler: It Doesnt Matter Because Nothing Beats A Three And A Six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Joey: Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.
Chandler: Not 700 exactly?
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: Double it! (He does.)
Joey: What?
Chandler: Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Joey: Really?
Chandler: Hey, I Didnt Make Up The Rules. Now, After You Receive The Doubling Bonus, You Get Uh, One Card. Now That One Card Could Be Worth $100 Bringing Your Total To 1,500. (Joey Gets Excited.) Dont Get To Excited Because Thats Not Gonna Happen Unless You Getno Way! (He Takes The Top Card, Which Is The Two Of Clubs. Of Course, Any Card Wouldve Won. Chandler Pays Him.) [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica carries a box out of Rachels room.]
Monica: Well, This Is The Last Box Of Your Clothes. Im Just Gonna Label it, "What were you thinking?"
Rachel: Funny, Because I Was Just Gonna Go Across The Hall And Write That On Chandler.
Phoebe: Hey You Guys, I Dont Mean To Make Things Worse, But Umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore.

Monica and Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: Youre Just So Mean To Each Other! And I Dont Want To End Up like that with Rachel. I still like you!

Phoebe: Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica: When I Fall Asleep On The Couch After Reading, She Covers Me Over With A blanket.

It Tis A Sad And Happy Time For Friends.) Ending Credits [Scene: Rosss Apartment, Chandler Is Trying To Get Joeys Money Back From Ross.]
Chandler: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Ross: And now you want that money back.
Chandler: Exactly.
Ross: Chandler, What Kind Of An Idiot Do You Take Me For? (As He Picks Up The fake Ben.)
Chandler: Its not a real game! I made it up!
Ross: Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Chandler: At a fake game!!
Ross: Now, If You Wanna Try To Make Some Of It Back, Id Be Glad To Play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Chandler: Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Ross: No.
Chandler: Hmm, Lets See If It Comes Up This Time. (He Looks At His Cards and shrugs.)
