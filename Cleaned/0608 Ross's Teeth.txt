Rachel: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.

Phoebe: But why didnt you just tell her the truth.

Rachel: I Did But She Doesnt Think Anyone Would Be Stupid Enough To Confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

Phoebe: Well, Hey, What If Kenny Were The Real Brains Behind The Whole Company? You Know. What If Kenny Hired That Ralph Lauren Guy To Be The Pretty Front Man? Huh, Did She ever think of that?

Rachel: You were with Kenny today, werent you?

Phoebe: Just for a second.

Rachel: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?

Phoebe: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
