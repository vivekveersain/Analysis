 [Scene: Monica And Chandlers Apartment, Everyone Except Ross Is Decorating The tree.]
Chandler: Let Me Ask You, Why Is Everybody Using These Tiny Lights Nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Rachel: Thats A Good Story, Grandpa. (Ross enters)
Ross: Hey
All: Hey
Ross: Wow, Monicas Letting Other People Help Decorate Her Tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Monica: Having A Perfectly Decorated Tree Is Not What Christmas Is About. Its about being with the people that you love.
Phoebe: That Is Nice And Were Done. Tada! (Her side of the tree looks a complete mess)
Chandler: I Dunno What It Is, It Just Doesnt Quite Feel Like Christmas To me.
Monica: Oh, Here. (She turns the tree around so that her side, which is perfectly decorated, is showing)
Chandler: See Now It Feels Like Christmas! Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Joey are there.]
Ross:  And Thats The Story Of The Dreidle. Now, Some People Trace The Christmas Tree Back To The Egyptians, Who Used To Bring Green Palm Branches Into Their Huts On The Shortest Day Of The Year, Symbolising Lifes Triumph Over Death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Rachel: So, Pretty Much Around The Same Time That You Started Telling This Story. (Joey enters)
Joey: Hey you guys.
Chandler: Hey Joe whats up?
Joey: I Had To Get Out Of The Apartment. Janine Is Like Stretching All Over The place. Yknow, everywhere I look shes like (He imitates her stretching)
Chandler: I can see why thats hard to resist.
Joey: I like her so much!
Monica: Aw, Im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way.
Joey: I Know. And Shes So Sweet. I Just Wanna Feed Her Grapes And Brush her hair.
Chandler: You are aware that shes not a monkey, right?
Ross: I Am So Over Janine. I Mean, Yeah, At First I Thought She Was Hot, But Now Shes Like Old News! (Janine enters)
Janine: Hey guys!
Ross: Hi Janine!
Janine: I Just Got A Call To Be A Dancer On A Television Special For New Years Eve. Its called some sort of Dickn Rockn Dickie Eve.
Monica: Hold It! Are You Talking About Dick Clarks New Years Rocking Eve?
Janine: Yeah, thats what I said.
Monica: Oh My God! We Love That Show! I Mean Ross And I Have Been Watching It since I can remember!
Chandler: Ah, Youre Still Just A Little Fat Girl Inside Arent You? (He kisses her on the cheek)
Janine: Well Im Gonna Be On It This Year. Im Gonna Be One Of The party people.
Ross: Youre gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Janine: Well They Said I Should Bring Someone. (To Joey) Do You Wanna Be My dance partner?
Joey: Totally! I would love to spend New Years with you.
Janine: Well Actually Theyre Taping Tomorrow. I Dont Really understand why.
Ross: Oh, Well You See How It Works Is, The Part With Dick Clark In Times Square Is Actually Live, But They Tape Some Of The Party Stuff Ahead Of Time. Yeah, Not A lot of people know that.
Janine: Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Ross: Are you serious?
Monica: We Are There! (Rachel laughs)
Chandler: What, what are you laughing at?
Rachel: Well, I Used To Date Him, But Youre Still Going Out With Her! (Gunther brings Janine a coffee)
Janine: Thanks. (To Monica And Ross) Great So We Can All Go Together! I Gotta Run. Catch You Later! (Janine leaves)
All: Bye!
Ross: Bye Janine!
Joey: Did she just ask me out on a date?
Chandler: I dont think so.
Monica: What Are You Talking About? She Just Invited Him To The Biggest Party Of the millennium!
Rachel: Yeah, But She Also Invited You And Ross. Yeah, Honey, Im Sorry, but I dont think that was a romantic thing.
Joey: Oh. Maybe. But Hey I Know How I Can Find Out. Were Going To A New Years Eve Party, Right? So At Midnight, I Can Kiss Her. And If She Kisses Me Back, Great! Yknow? But If She Says Dude, What The Hell Are You Doing? I Can say It wasnt me, it was New Years!
Rachel: Well, Thats A Lot Better Than Ross Trying To Kiss Me In High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Ross: It was a dry day.
Monica: We are going to Dick Clarks New Years Rocking Eve!
Ross: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh my God!
Chandler: (To Rachel) Oh My God! [Scene: The Set, Joey, Janine, Ross and Monica are walking in.]
Joey: Ok, Listen Ive Been On Sets Before, So Let Me Give You A Little Advice, Alright? Its A Show, But Were Just Dancing, Ok? Its No Big Deal. The important thing to remember  stay cool.

Rachel: Chandler, Arent You Worried About What To Get Monica For Christmas?
Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe: Oh, thats it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!
Rachel: Chandler, Thats Not Enough. I Mean What If She Gets You A Great Present, Two Medium Presents, And A Bunch Of Little Presents? And Youve Just Gotten Her One Great Present? I Mean Thats Just Gonna Make Her Feel Bad. Why Would You Do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Chandler: If I help, we can find em faster!
Rachel: Thats Right! (Phoebe looks under the couch)
Phoebe: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Rachel: Oh, Its A Macys Bag! (Phoebe tips it upside down, and a shoe falls out)

Phoebe: Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Rachel: We are so gonna find them this year.
Chandler: Yknow When You Guys Said You Were Gonna Go Across The Hall And look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you?

Phoebe And Rachel: No, We Never Do That (They turn away.)
Chandler: Because Thats Where Joey Gave Me Some Stuff To Store That Ive Never Seen Before In My Life! Okay, That Did Not Just Happen! (He Does A Weird Clicky Motion With His Fingers, That Kinda Hard To Describe.) [Scene: The Set, everyone is dancing.]
Monica: Okay, here comes another camera.
Ross: Right. No Biggie. Stay Loose. (As The Camera Passes By, They Start To Dance Really Rigid, But The Camera Is Facing the other way.)
Ross: Why do they keep doing that?
Monica: If We Wanna Get On Camera, I Think We Have To Get Up On One Of Those platforms. Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
Ross: Right. (They move towards a platform, dancing really strangely as they go)
Ross: Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
Girl: We learned how to dance.
Monica: Oh Yeah? Well When You Learned How To Dance Did You Forget How To Put On underpants?
Ross: Yeah! (Camera pans to Joey and Janine)
Janine: Hey! Youre a good dancer!
Joey: Really?
Janine: Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Joey: What do you mean?
Janine: Like This. (She pulls Joey towards her and dances really close to him.)
Janine: Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.
Joey: Uh-huh.
Director: (To Joey) Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.
