Phoebe: I didnt know Playboy prints jokes.
Ross: Yeah, They Print Jokes, Interviews, Hard-Hitting Journalism. Its Not just about the pictures.
Monica: That didnt work on mom, its not going to work on us.

Chandler: That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.

Chandler: Yes, I Did. I Told It To Dan At Work, And He Said It Was The Funniest joke hed ever heard.
Ross: Hey, Tell Dan, Thanks. (Rachel is looking at the magazine and laughing.)
Ross: What?
Rachel: Im Sorry, I Was Just Reading The Joke Below It. Man, That One Is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
Chandler: Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Monica: No.
Chandler: Seriously?
Monica: Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Ross: Look, Chandler, Its My Joke. But, Hey, If It Makes You Feel Any Better They Dont Print The Name, So It Doesnt Really Matter Who Gets Credit, right?
Chandler: Yeah, I guess.
Joey: (entering) Hey guys.
Chandler: (Jumping Up From His Chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Ross: No, Its My Joke, Its Mine. You Can Call Them, Theyll tell you.
Chandler: Its my joke.
Ross: Its my joke.
Joey: Whoa-Whoa-Whoa. Jokes? You Guys Know They Have Naked Chicks In There, Right? Opening Credits [Scene: Joeys apartment, Joey is sitting at the counter as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Dude, You Have Got To Turn On Behind The Music. The Band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Joey: Lets go watch it at your place.

Joey: No, Thats Vh-1. I Gotta Tell You, The Music These Kids Listen to today . . . Its like a lotta noise to me. I dont know
Chandler: Joey, why is your cable out?
Joey: I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill
Chandler: If You Need Money, Will You Please-Please Just Let Me Loan You Some money?
Joey: No, Chandler. Look, Forget About It, Okay? Look, I Know Things Have Been A little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. 
Chandler: Whoa ho.
Joey: I Know! Yeah, But, Look I Can Handle It. All Right? Look, I Can Listen To the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).
Chandler: (Picks Up The Phone) All Right, You Want To See If The Joke Stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Joey: Sure.
Chandler: (With Phone To Ear, Obviously Hearing No Dial Tone) Paid Your Phone bill?
Joey: Not So Much. [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S, Monica And Rachel Are On The Couch Looking At The Playboy magazine. When they hear someone coming, Monica goes to hide it under the sofa cushions.] 
Phoebe: (entering) Hey.
Monica: (relieved) Its only you.
Phoebe: Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Rachel: We are looking at a Playboy.
Phoebe: Oh, I Want To Look Too! (She Runs Over And Sits Down And Checks Out A picture). Yikes!
Monica: So Do You Think That These Picturesare, Are They Trying To Tell A story?
Rachel: Oh, Yeah, Sure. I Mean, Like In The Case Of This Young Woman, She Has Lost Her Clothes, So She Rides Naked On The Horse, Shes Crying Out, Where Are they, where are they?
Monica: Well, Shes Not Going To Find Them Lying In The Grass Like That. (They flip through the pages to another picture.)
Phoebe: Oh, Yeah. Aw, Remember The Days When You Used To Go Out To The Barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?

Rachel and Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: You See, Now, I Would Date This Girl. Shes Cute, Shes Outdoorsy, You Know, And She Knows How To Build A Fire. I Mean, Thats Got To Come In handy
Monica: Okay, Ive Got A Question. If You Had To Pick One Of Us To Date, who would it be?
Rachel: (thinks) I dont know.
Monica: Me neither.
Phoebe: Rachel.
Monica: What?!
Phoebe: I Dont Know. (Pause) Me Neither. [Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Ross are sitting on the couch.]
Joey: You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Chandler: Yeah.
Ross: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Chandler: So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Joey: Oh, You Guys, With This Joke. I Gotta Say, I Know I Cracked Up, But Im not even sure I got it.
Ross: What, You Didnt Get It? The Doctor Is A Monkey. (He and Chandler crack up.)
Chandler: And Monkeys Cant Write Out Prescriptions. (He and Ross crack up again. Joey just sits there)
Chandler: (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Ross: Your Joke? Well, I Think The Hef Would Disagree, Which Is Why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Chandler: So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Ross: Well, I Was Going To Stick It In The Atm, But Now I Think Ill Show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Chandler: Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Ross: Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Chandler: Yeah!
Ross: Well, Im not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
Chandler: Okay (He Goes To Sit Down). (Ross leaps out of his chair and runs out the door, with Chandler in hot pursuit.)
Gunther: (handing Joey the bill) Here you go.
Joey: Ah, Gunther, I Cant Pay For This Right Now Because Im Not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
Gunther: Well, if you want, you can work here.
Joey: Uh, I Dont Know. Ya See, Its Just, See I Was A Regular On A Soap Opera Yknow? And To Go From That To This, I Just Plus, Id Have To wait on all my friends.
Gunther: Okay, But The Moneys Good, Plus You Get To Stare At Rachel As much as you want.
Joey: What?!
Gunther: Flexible hours.
Joey: Maybe I Could Be A Waiter. Could I Use The Phone? [Scene: Monica and Chandlers bedroom, they are in bed together.]
Monica: (Visibly Upset) She Picked Rachel. I Mean, She Tried To Back Out Of It, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Chandler: (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it. 
Monica: Its wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Chandler: You Know Who Else Picked Rachel? Ross, And You Know What Else Ross Did? He Stole My Joke. You Know What? Im Going To Get A Joke Journal. Yknow? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Monica: Thats a good idea. 
Chandler: Yeah!
Monica: Do you know whats a bad idea?
Chandler: Picking Rachel.
Monica: Thats Right. (A Noise Comes From The Living Room.) Did You Hear something?
Chandler: Maybe Its The Sound Of Ross Climbing Into My Brain And Stealing my thoughts.
Monica: Its Coming From The Living Room. (They Go Out To Investigate, And Find Joey Wrapped In A Blanket Watching Their television.)
Joey: (Sheepishly) I Finished My Book. (Chandler And Monica Slowly Retreat Back To Bed.) [Scene, Phoebe and Rachels, theyre sitting together on the couch.]
Monica: (entering) Hey, you guys.

Phoebe and Rachel: Hey.
Monica: (Laughing) Oh, Dont You Guys Look Cute. You Guys Make such a cute couple.
Rachel: Monica, what are you doing?
Monica: (Laughing Harder) Nothing, Im Just Trying To Recreate Some Of The Fun That We Had At My Place The Other Day. (To Phoebe) Remember, When You picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Phoebe: I guess it was kinda funny.
Monica: (Angrily) It Wasnt Funny At All! Why Would You Do That? Why didnt you pick me?
Phoebe: Fine. The Reason That I Was Leaning A Little Bit More Toward Rachel Than You Is Just That Youre  Just  Kinda High Maintenanceokay lets go to lunch!
Monica: That Is Completely Untrue. You Think Im High Maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point!
Phoebe: No, Okay, Youre Right. Youre Easy-Going. Youre Just Not As Easy-Going As Rachel. Shes Just More Flexible And-And Mellow. Thats all.
Rachel: (To Monica) Well, people are different.
Phoebe: Ya, You Know, Rachel  Shell Do Whatever You Want. Yknow, you can just walk all over her.
Rachel: What? Wait A Minute. What Are You Saying, That Im A Pushover? Im not a pushover.

Joey: No.
Customer: Hey, waiter.
Joey: Yeah? Commercial Break [Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]

Joey: I Mean, The Jobs Easy And The Moneys Good, You Know? I Guess Im Going To Be Hanging Out Here Anyway. I Might As Well Get Paid For It, Right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Rachel: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Ross: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Joey: Okay, I guess it doesnt seem that weird.
Ross: Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still havent gotten it.
Joey: See, now its weird again.
Chandler: I Think Its Great That You Work Here. Youre Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Heres Your First Tip: Dont Eat Yellow Snow. (He Laughs, Then Picks Up A Pen, Glares At Ross, And Writes In His Journal). Ah Ha Ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Rachel: Well, You Know What? This Is Great. Finally, I Have Someone I Can Pass On My Wisdom Too. Let Me Tell You About A Couple Of Things I Learned While Working At The Coffeehouse. First Of All, The Customer Is Always Right. (Joey Nods.) A Smile Goes A Long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey: Thanks, Rach. Look, You Guys Are Just Terrific. Yknow? Now, How about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. Its all about turnover.
Ross: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Joey: Oh, Im Sorry, Ross. Ill Get It For You Right Now. And Since I Made You Wait, Ill Toss In A Free Muffin. (He Looks At Rachel And Winks, She Gives Him The Thumbs-Up Sign.) [Scene: Phoebe And Rachels, Phoebe Is Sitting On The Couch As Rachel And Monica enter.]

Chandler: So Steve Said He Had To Go To The Doctor. And Steves Doctors Name Is Doctor Muppy. So I Said, Doctor Monkey? And That Is How The Whole Doctor Monkey Thing Came Up. (He Slams His Feet Up On The Table To Emphasize His point.)
Ross: Are You Kidding? Okay, Look. I-I Studied Evolution. Remember, Evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey!
Chandler: Im not arguing with that.
Monica: All Right, Ive Heard Enough. Ive Made My Decision. (Both Chandler and Ross are eager to hear her decision.) 
Monica: You Are Both Idiots. The Joke Is Not Funny, And Its Offensive To Women, And Doctors, And Monkeys! You Shouldnt Be Arguing Over Who Gets Credit, You Should Be Arguing Over Who Gets Blamed For Inflicting This Horrible Joke Upon The World! Now Let It Go! The Joke Sucks!  (Monica leaves the room)

Monica: Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Chandler: Hi, oh hi.
Monica: Hey, Its Phoebe And Rachel. Um, Why Dont You Tell Them What You Were Telling Me Earlier About Me Not Being High Maintenance? (Rachel and Phoebe exchange looks.)
Chandler: (Starts To Recite A Rehearsed Speech) Monica Is A Self-Sufficient, Together Lady. (Pause.) Being With Her Has Been Like Being On A Vacation. And What May Be Perceived As High Maintenance Is Merely Attention To Detail And(He Falters And Monica prompts him.)generosity of spirit.
Rachel: Wow, You Know What? That Is The Best Fake Speech I Think Ive Ever heard.
Phoebe: Really? Ive heard better.
Monica: Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Chandler: (To Chandler) Im Out Of Words. Should I Just Say The Whole Thing again?
Monica: Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Chandler: (Pauses As He Struggles With What He Has To Say) Youre A Little high maintenance.
Monica: Ahhh! You are on my list.
Chandler: Im Sorry. Youre Not Easy-Going, But Youre Passionate, And Thats Good. And When You Get Upset About The Little Things, I Think That Im Pretty Good About Making You Feel Better About That. And Thats Good Too. So, They Can Say That Youre High Maintenance, But Its Okay, Because I like  maintaining you.
Monica: (Embarrassed) (To Phoebe And Rachel) I Didnt Even Tell Him To Say that. (They hug). All right youre off my list. 
Chandler: (happily) Im off the list. (Sits on the couch.) 
Monica: (Sits Next To Him) Phoebe, Its Okay That You Dont Want Me To be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.

Phoebe: Wow! That is a bad audition.
Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?
