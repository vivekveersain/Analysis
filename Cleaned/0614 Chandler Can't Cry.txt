Phoebe: Oh Yknow Whats Sadder Than This? Bambi. I Cried For Three Days With That Movie. No Wait Two! Because On The Third Day My Mother Killed Herself so I was partly crying for that.
Chandler: (Totally Not Crying) Well See Now That I Can See Crying Over, But Bambi is a cartoon!
Joey: (crying) You didnt cry when Bambis mother died?
Chandler: Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Monica: Chandler Theres Nothing Wrong With Crying! I Mean You Dont have to be so macho all the time.
Chandler: Im not macho.
Monica: Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking.
Chandler: No, I Guess I Just Never Really Cried. Yknow? Im Not A crying kind of guy.
Joey: Come On Man Theres Gotta Be Something That Gets You Choked Up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Chandler: Id be sad sure, but I wouldnt cry.

Chandler: Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
Rachel: Oh my God!
Monica: Thats Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Joey: Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Ross: And-And I, And I Saw That Joey Was About To Go In, So I Ran In Ahead Of Him To-To Surprise Him And, And Then I Pretended I Didnt Know He Was In There. (They all kinda look at him.)
Rachel: Wow! I Mean, I Justi Cant, I Cant Believe This. Yknow, I Mean You Think You Know Someone Even, Even Phoebe Whos Always Been somewhat of a question mark.
Monica: This Is So Bizarre. I Guess It Kinda Makes Sense Though, Yknow She had such a terrible childhood.
Chandler: Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I dont do porn.
Monica: Yes, but you are dead inside.
Joey: All right well, Id better take that back.
Monica: Wh-what, why?

Rachel: Probably just the first half.
Joey: No! Hey No! This Is Wrong You Guys! Phoebes Our Friend! Well, Im not gonna watch it!
Ross: Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Joey: Yeah. (Ross Stands Next To Him For A Second, Then Goes And Watches The Movie.) (The Movie Starts, Its A Vampires Lair And Buffay, The Vampire Layer Enters Dressed In Leather And Carrying A Wooden Stake. Suddenly, The Vampire Opens His Coffin And sits up.
Buffay, the Vampire Layer: Ah, I thought Id find you here, Nasforatool.
The Vampire: Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Buffay, The Vampire Layer: Actually, I Was Kinda Hoping It Would Be The Other Way Around. (At This Point, Buffay, The Vampire Layer And Nasforatool Start To Get It On. Of Course, Since This Is Network Tv, We Can Only See The Reactions Of The Gang To The Film playing off screen.)
Monica: Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Chandler: Her ankle is what youre watching?
Rachel: Well Its Hard To Tell (Rachel Gets Up To Get A Closer Look, only shes having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Chandler: Shes just doing her job!

Rachel: Oh, Its A Tattoo! Thats Weird, Phoebe Doesnt Wait Thats Ursula! Thats Not Phoebe That Is Ursula! (Upon Hearing This, Joey Cant Turn His Chair Around Fast Enough And Knocks It over.)
Joey: Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Phoebe: (Entering) Hey! Whats Up? (Sees The Tv) Oh My God! What Am I Doing?!! Commercial Break [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S, Chandler Is Reading Chicken Soup For The Soul As Monica enters.]
Monica: Hey sweetie!
Chandler: Hey! (He Quickly Tries To Hide The Book By Throwing It Under The couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
Monica: (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul? 
Chandler: Theres no back to this couch!
Monica: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Chandler: Yeah I Know, But I Figured A Shot Yknow? Maybe One Of Those Stories Would Make Me Cry And Then You Wouldnt Think I Was Yknow, All Dead inside.
Monica: Oh Thats So Sweet! Look Chandler I Dont Care If You cant cry, I love you.
Chandler: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Monica: Stop it!
Chandler: No, I Mean, Come On, Seriously Think About It, We Get Married, were up at the altar and Im like this. (Makes a bored face.)
Monica: I Wont Care, Because I Know You Will Be Feeling It All In Here. (Points to her heart.)
Chandler: Yeah?
Monica: Yeah! And If, And If We Have A Baby One-Day, And The Doctor Hands It To You In The Delivery Room And You Dont Cry, So What! And-And-And, And If We Take Him To College And Come Home And See His Empty Room For The First Time, And You Got Nothing, it wont matter to me.
Chandler: Okay, well I wont uh, worry about this anymore then.
Monica: And-And-And If I Die, From A Long Illness. And Youre Writing Out My Eulogy And You Open A Desk Drawer And You Find A Note From Me That Says, "I Will Always Be With You," And You Still Cant Shed One Tiny Tear, I Know Youll be crying a river inside.
Chandler: Aww, I love you so
Monica: What is wrong with you?!!!
Chandler: What?!
Monica: What?! You Cant Shed A Tear For Your Dead Wife!! Now, I Left You A note from the beyond!
Chandler: So you didnt mean any of that?!

Umm, Theyve Really Taken A Liking To Me. (Quickly Looks Out To See If Theyre Watching.) Uhh whats-whats-whats the matter?
Jill: Rachel And I Had A Really Big Fight, Can I Come In? I-I Mean I Know Were Not Supposed To See Each Other Anymore And Im Okay With That, Its Just That I Dont Know Anybody In The City And I Really Need Somebody To Talk To about it.
Ross: Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)
Jill: (entering) I dont want to talk about it.
Ross: Okay, umm
Jill: But you know what might really cheer me up?
Ross: What?
Jill: Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Ross: Wow! Really?!
Jill: Totally, I Love Them! And, Maybe You Could Finish Telling Me About All The different kinds of sand.
Ross: Well, Id Love To! Here, You Wait Right Here And Ill Go Get The projector and my notes!
Jill: Oh great! Thanks Ross, youre such a good friend!
Ross: Ohh! (He Goes Into Another Room To Get His Projector And Notes. While Hes Gone, Jill Quickly Checks Her Makeup. [Cut to Monica and Chandlers, Rachel is entering.]
Rachel: Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I cant find her anywhere.
Monica: No, I havent.
Rachel: Well, Is Ross Home? Maybe Ill Just Call Him To See If Hes Actually Seen Her.
