Monica: Now, This Is Last Minute So I Want To Apologize For The Mess. Okay? (They Walk Into A Completely Redecorated And Repainted Room. And Of Course, The Room Is immaculate. Only an obsessive-compulsive like Monica could find fault with the room.)
Rachel: Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here.
Monica: I Know! Now Look, Theres Only One Problem Though. Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
Phoebe: Well, Since The Fire Was Kinda My Fault I Guess (To Rachel) You Should get to stay here.
Rachel: Hey! Hey-Hey, Now This Was No Ones Fault Pheebs. Okay? It Was An accident.

Elizabeth: Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Ross: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Elizabeth: Who?
Ross: Oh Uh, I Had Trouble Remembering Everyones Name, So I-I Kinda Came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Elizabeth: Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Ross: Umm, no. No.
Elizabeth: Yes you did! What was it?
Ross: Umm, its Cutie McPretty.
Elizabeth: Ohh thats so sweet!
Ross: Listen, I Gotta Tell Ya, I-Im Having A Great Time! Yknow How Before You Said It Might Be Weird, The Whole Student Teacher Thing, And To Be Frank I thought it would be too, but its not. I mean its not at all.

Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Gum!
Fireman #2: Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Phoebe: Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Fireman #2: No, There Was An Appliance Left On In The Bathroom. Its Looks like a curling iron.
Phoebe: I dont use a curling iron.
Fireman #2: Well Someone Does. (Phoebe looks at Rachel.)
Rachel: Well, Dont Look At Me! My Hairs Straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Fireman #2: It couldve been a hair straightener.

Monica: Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Phoebe: Thanks Monica!
Monica: Does that smell bother you?
Phoebe: What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Monica: Well You Let Me Know If You Can, Because Yknow I Can Bake A Pie To cover it.
Phoebe: I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Monica: Okay!
Phoebe: Okay. (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
Monica: Hello? (Listens) Oh Yes, One Minute Please. (To Phoebe) Its For you. Its the fire inspector.
Phoebe: Oh! (Takes The Phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah This Is Phoebe. (Listens) Really?! [Cut to Joeys, hes on the phone.]
Joey: (In A Funny Voice) Yeah, So It Turns Out That It Wasnt The Hair Straightener That Started The Fire. (Rachel Prompts Him On What To Say Next.) No-No, It Was The Candles. Its Very Not Good Leaving Candles Unattended. In Fact, One Of The First Things They Teach You In Fire School Is (Phoebe Suddenly Enters.) Uhh Uhh Okay. Well, I Have To Go Now. (Phoebe Leaves.) [Scene: Joey'S Apartment, Ross Is Telling Monica And Joey About His Date With Elizabeth.]
