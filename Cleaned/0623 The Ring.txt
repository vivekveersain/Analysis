Chandler: Pheebs, Can You Help Me Pick Out An Engagement Ring For Monica? I Cant Figure This Out! Its So Hard! Should I Get Her A (Turning To Each Page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! Paper cut!
Phoebe: Now, have you told anyone else?
Chandler: No, I Dont Want To Tell Anybody Else Because I Dont Want Monica to find out.
Phoebe: You told me.
Chandler: Well, Its Because I Trust You, Youre One Of My Best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Phoebe: Yeah Well, Once Again Not Knocking Pays Off. I Only Wish You Hadnt been on the toilet.
Chandler: Me Too. (Joey and Ross enter causing Chandler to quickly hide the brochure behind his back.)
Joey: Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? 
Chandler: Oh all right.
Phoebe: Yeah, coffeehouse.
Ross: Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Chandler: Oh Well, We Dont Because We Gottheother Pl-Place. (Joey returns with a piece of pizza as Chandler and Phoebe exit.)
Ross: How rude.
Joey: Oh, Im Sorry. You Wanna Bite? (Holds His Piece Out For Him.) Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
Phoebe: So how are things going with Paul?
Rachel: Good. Although Yknow, He-Hes A Private Guy. Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Phoebe: Thats Easy! You Just Have To Think Of Him As A-As A Jar Of Pickles that wont open.
Rachel: So What Are You Saying; I Should Run Him Under Hot Water And Bang His head against a table?
Phoebe: No Thats What You Do When You Want To Get The Truth Out Of someone.
Paul: (entering) Hi honey.
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Watch this.
Paul: (To Rachel) How are you?
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Okay.
Phoebe: Hi Paul!
Paul: Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe: So how are things going with you?
Paul: Cant Complain. (Phoebe Turns To Rachel And Mimes Remove A Lid Of A Jar. Ross Enters And Paul Motions for Rachel to leave with him now.)
Paul: (whispering) Come on.
Rachel: Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)

Paul: Ross! 
Ross: Great to see you!
Paul: Good to see you too!
Ross: How you doing?
Paul: Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)
Ross: Okay! You Take Care!  (Ross Turns His Back On Paul And Makes A I Hate That Guy Face. Paul Does the same thing.)
Ross: Hey Pheebs, What-What Was The Deal With You And Chandler Blowing Us Off before?
Phoebe: Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Ross: Phoebe, whyd you do it?
Phoebe: I Didnt Do It! It Was Chandler! Hes Hes Mad At you!
Ross: What?! Why?!
Phoebe: Please, I think you know why.
Ross: I cant think of anything.
Phoebe: Come on Ross, youre a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Ross: Wait A Minute, Is It Because Joey And I Didnt Invite Him To That Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Phoebe: Do you think thats something that hed be mad at you for?
Ross: I guess it could.
Phoebe: Well then I think thats it.
Ross: Well, If Hes Angry, He Really Shouldnt Just Cover It Up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Phoebe: Oh, If Thats What You Want You Then You Really Should Run His Head Under Hot Water And Bang His Head Against A Table. [Scene: Joey And Rachel'S, Paul And Rachel Are Getting Ready To Go Out. Paul Is entering from the bathroom.]
Paul: Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Rachel: Yeah Thats Great. But First, Wait, Talk To Me, Talk To Me. Tell Me about your day.

Rachel: No Paul, I Dont Know Anything About You! Yknow, Like-Like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Paul: Normal.
Rachel: Okay, Well Then How About Puberty! Come On, Thats Always A Painful Time! Yknow Your Friends Invite You To A Slumber Party And Then They Stick Your Hand in warm water while youre sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.

Paul: It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.

Rachel: My God, Im Sorry! Im Sorry! I Didnt Mean To Do That! I Wouldnt Do That! (Paul Screams Like A Chicken And Breaks Down Into Tears Again.) [Scene: A Jewelry Shop, Chandler and Phoebe are looking at engagement rings.]

Monica: Still crying?
Rachel: Like A Little Girl. I Know. I Know. I Know. This Is All My Fault; I Wanted Him To Open Up. But God, I Didnt Know That I Was Gonna Unleash This-This weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Monica: Yknow, I Only Know Of Two Surefire Ways To Shut A Man Up. And One of them is sex.
Rachel: Whats the other one?
Monica: I Dont Know, Ive Never Had To Use The Other One. Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.

Paul: What?! I Cant Believe Youre Trying To Stifle Me! When Just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Rachel: Oh Im Sorry. I I-I Dont Meani Didnt mean to stifle you. I This is all just a little overwhelming.
Paul: Oh Rachel, Im So Sorry. I Didnt Mean To Overwhelm You. Its Just That, When Those Gates Open, You (Starts To Breakdown.) Hard To Close em. But they are closed now. Believe me.

Phoebe: Its Not A Stupid Gumball Machine Looking Ring! Its A beautiful ring!
Chandler: No, Its Not! When I Looked At The Other Ring I Could See Monicas Face When I Gave It To Her, Yknow? And I Could See Her Saying Yes. When I Look At This Ring, All I See Is A Ring! Unless I Look At It Really Closely And Then I Can See My Own Eye. (Does So And Laughs.) Look, This Is The Most Important Thing Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect.
Phoebe: Okay. There May Be A Way That We Can Get The Other Ring Back. Cause I Heard The Guy Tell The Jeweler Where He Was Going To Propose. So Maybe We can get him to trade rings or something.
Chandler: I cant do that.
Phoebe: Well You Certainly Cant Give Her That Stupid Gumball Ring. [Scene: A Restaurant, Chandler And Phoebe Are Entering. This Is The Place Where The Guy who bought Chandlers ring is going to propose.]
Phoebe: There he is! (Points.)
Chandler: Okay And He Hasnt Proposed Yet Because She Has No Ring On Her finger.
