Phoebe: If you dont sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Joey: Oh, Its Great! Its A Great Place To Just Kinda, Sit, Hang Around, Drink A Few Beers, Eat Some Chips. (He Says That As He Sits, Hangs Around, Drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)
Chandler: Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.
Rachel: Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.

Ross: Yeah And He Didnt Really Ask For You, He Asked For Chancy, I Assumed he meant you.
Chandler: Well, did-did you correct him?
Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Monica: This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Ross: Or You Can Sit With Him On The Front Porch And Make Sure No One Steals The trash cans. He does that every week too.
Monica: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: He hates to lose.
Chandler: Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.
Ross: Youre not a lefty? 
Chandler: Does Anybody Know Me?! (Phoebe enters, walks up to Monica, and exhales exasperatedly.)
Monica: Whats wrong Phoebe?
Phoebe: I Just Went To My Old Apartment To Get You The-The Cookie Recipe And The stupid fire burned it up!
Monica: No!! Why Didnt You Make A Copy And-And Keep It In A Fireproof Box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Phoebe: (Pauses As He Figures Out How To Answer That) Because Im Normal! That Was The One Legacy My Grandmother Left Me, And I Know You Wanted It As An engagement present.

Chandler: Okay, we owe you a present.
Ross: Two! Ive Been Engaged Twice! [Scene: The Mr. Bowmont (Joeys Boat), Shes Shown To Be In One Of The Waterways Around New York, But In Reality Shes In A Sound Stage On The Warner Bros. Lot And We See New York From The Water In Some Rather Poor Green Screen Shots. Rachel And Joey are on board.]
Joey: (Drinking A Beer) Look At This Clown! Just Because Hes Got A Bigger Boat He Thinks He Can Take Up The Whole River. (Yelling) Get Out Of The Way Jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Rachel: That is the Coast Guard. 
Joey: What Are They Doing Out Here? The Coasts All The Way Over There. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)

Joey: Yes.
Rachel: Dont Just Say Yes! This Isnt A Game, Joey You Can Really Get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Joey: I Want To Make A Ship To Shore Call To Chandler. [Scene: Monica, Chandler, And Phoebe'S, Monica And Phoebe Are Trying To Determine The cookie recipe by eating small pieces.]
Monica: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Phoebe: You do?
Monica: You Dont? (Laughs) Well, Thats The Difference Between A professional and a layman.
Phoebe: That and arrogance.
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Monica: Hey! How was sailing?
Joey: I Dont Want To Talk About It. Yknow, You Couldve At Least Saved Me A Whole Cookie. (He Grabs Whats Left Of The Cookie And Pops In His mouth.)

Monica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Joey: (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
Phoebe: I Cant Believe That! Now The Only Thing Left Of My Grandmothers Legacy Is This Crumb. (She Picks It Up With Her Finger And Holds It Out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Ross: (entering with Chandler) Hey.
Monica: Hey! How was it?
Ross: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
Chandler: I Will Tell The Story! It Was Going Great. I Let Him Win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Ross: And what did he ask you not to call him?
Chandler: Daddy. All Right Look, Heres The Story. (Flashback To Chandler About To Enter The Steam Room As He Does The Voice-Over.) Well, We Had Just Finished Playing Racquetball And We Were Gonna Take A Steam. I Walk Into The Steam Room And It Was Really Steamy. (The Flashback Shows His Glasses Fog Up And Him Trying To Find His Way Around The Steam Filled Room. He Takes Off His Glasses.) So I Take Off My Glasses And Thats When In Happened. [Cut to the flashback, Chandlers no longer doing the voice-over.]
Chandler: Guys?
Ross: Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
Mr. Geller: Have A Seat Son. (You Can See Mr. Geller Sitting Closer To The Door As Chandler Walks Over And Sits In His Lap.) Hey!! (Chandler Quickly Jumps Off And Sits Next To Him With A Shocked Expression On His Face.) Commercial Break [Scene: Monica, Chandler, And Phoebe'S, Chandler Is Finished Telling Everyone What happened.]
Monica: Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!
Chandler: I know.
Monica: You gave my father a lap dance!
Chandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Ross: Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.
Chandler: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Phoebe: Come on, its not that big a deal!
Chandler: Not that big a deal? Therethere was touching of things.
Ross: Now, I Know You Wanted To Bond With My Dad, But Did You Really Have To bond to that part?
Monica: Listen, Im Sure That Dad Doesnt Care. He Probably Thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!
Chandler: I dont want him to tell this story for years.
Ross: Oh, But He Will. He Still Tells The Story How Monica Tried To Escape From fat camp.
Monica: I wasnt escaping.
Ross: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Monica: I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Ross: You Were Trying To Eat It! (The phone rings.)
Chandler: If That Is Your Father Calling To Tell This Story Then The marriage is off!
Monica: (Takes The Phone From Ross) Come On. (Answering Phone) Hello? (Listens) Im Sorry You Have The Wrong Number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Ill Call You Later Dad. I Love You. (Hangs Up.) [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are there.]
Chandler: (getting up) All right, Im off to see your dad.
Ross: Whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?
Rachel: (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Chandler: Look, I Figured I Would Try To Convince Him Not To Tell The Story Anymore, And I Figure The Best Way To Do That Is Face To Faceand By Face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass. (Exits.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Rachel: I dont know. Yknow, they didnt get us anything.
Ross: Thank you!
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettin back out on the water matey? 
Joey: Oh uh, I dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Rachel: Why not?
Joey: Because! Youre mean on the boat!
Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.
Joey: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Ross: Yeeeeeep Yep-Yep-Yep-Yep-Yep. I Remember When She Took Out On Her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all.
Rachel: Excuse Me, I Wanted You To Help, But You Couldnt Move Your Arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Ross: You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
Rachel: Look Joey, Im Sorry If-If You Thought That Was Mean, But I Gotta Tell Ya Something. That Was Not Mean. Okay, My Father Is Mean. He Used To Yell At Me All the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Joey: Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Rachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Joey: Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Rachel: Yeah, I didnt want you to get hit by the boom!
Joey: Well It Hit Me Anyway! And It Wouldve Hurt A Lot Less If I Had finished that last beer.
Rachel: All Right, Yknow What? I-Im Sorry. I Will Try To Tone It down and uh stop yelling.
Joey: You wont boss me around anymore?
Rachel: I wont boss you around.
Joey: And youll be nice?
Rachel: And, Ill be nice.
Joey: And youll be topless?
Rachel: AndJoey!
Joey: Do You Want Me To Learn?! [Scene: Monica, Chandler, And Phoebe'S, Monica Is Trying Out Different Cookie Recipes. Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.]
Monica: Okay, Heres Batch 22. Ohh, Maybe Thesell Taste A Little Like your grandmothers. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Ross: Lets give it a shot.
Monica: Okay. Man, I Have Not Made This Many Cookies Since I Was In The ninth grade.
Phoebe: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Monica: No, Just A Friday Night. (They all take a bite.)
Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.
Phoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Ross: Which one was that?
Monica: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Ross: Oh Yeah! Batch 17 Was Good. I Did Not Like Batch 16. (Burps A little bit.) Im okay.
Phoebe: Are There Anymore From The Good Batch? Cause We Could Just Work off of those.
Ross: Yeah, Ooh Yeah, I Think There Is One From Batch 17 Left, Uh (Grabs A Cookie And Takes A Big Bite Out Of It And Doesnt Like It.) Its Batch 16! 16 People! Get Out Of The Way! (Gets Up And Runs For The Bathroom.) [Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, Its Joeys Second Lesson With Rachel As The Resident sailing expert.]
Rachel: Okay Joey Honey, Youre Doing Really Good! All Right, Now Im Just Gonna Need You To Step To The Port Side. (Joey Pauses As He Tries To Remember Which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Joey: Ohh yeah.
Rachel: Right?
Joey: Nope.
Rachel: Its Left Sweetie, But Thats Okay Sweetie, Thats A tough one.
Joey: I dont know why you just dont say left.
Rachel: Okay, Go To The Left. (Joey Goes Starboard Or Sits On The Right Side Of the boat.) The left!
Joey: Huh?
Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
Joey: (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, youre yelling again! See that?
Rachel: No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Joey: Oh, Yknow What? Since Im Here, I Think Im Gonna Have Me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)
Rachel: Okay Joey, Were Luffing A Little Bit, So Could You Tighten Up The Cunningham? (The Mainsail Has Started To Flap In The Wind And Has Stopped Working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
Joey: Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnt know there.
Rachel: Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
Joey: Oh, Yknow, When We Did That Was When That Bird Was Flying Overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Rachel: (Angrily) No! All Right?! I Did Not See The Bird! I Did Not See The Fish! I Did Not See The Piece Of Styrofoam That Was Shaped Like Mike Tyson! I Did Not, Because I Was Trying To Teach You How To Sail A Boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Joey: All Right Thats It! Youre Yelling And I Dont See You taking your top off! I quit!
Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You cant quit!
Joey: Why not?!
Rachel: Because Youre Not Finished Yet And I Wont Have It! Greens Do not quit!
Joey: Greens? Im a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Rachel: Oh My God, Wait Did Ii Just Said Greens Dont Quit didnt I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens dont quit?!
Joey: Yes! Yes! You did and youre still yelling at me!
Rachel: No! No! No! Im Not Yelling At You, Im Just Yelling Near You. Oh God Joey, Ohh Im My Father. Oh My God, This Is Horrible! Ive Been Trying So Hard Not To Be My Mother I Did Not See This Comin. Oh, Joey, Im Sorry. Im so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Joey: Well, hey I did learn.
Rachel: Really?
Joey: Yeah! Come on.
Rachel: Awww
Joey: Yeah, Its Okay. I Know What A Mainsail Is. (Points To It. Its The Larger Sail.) I Know, I Know To Duck When The Boom Comes Across. I-I Know Port Is right.
Rachel: Left.
Joey: Damnit! [Scene: Monica, Chandler, And Phoebe'S, The Cookie Trying Period Has Pasted. Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are reflecting on the days events.]
Phoebe: Yknow, I Bet It Would Actually Make My Grandmother Very Happy To Know That Were Trying To Figure Out Her Recipe. I Bet Shes L-L-Lookin Up at us and smiling right now.
Ross: Looking up?
Phoebe: Oh Yeahno, She Was Really Nice To Me, But Shes In Hell For sure.
Monica: Well, Ive Tried Everything. I Give Up. I Guess Im Not Gonna Be The Mom Who Makes The Worlds Best Chocolate Cookies. I Do Make The Best Duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Ross: Aww, Pheeb, Come On Isnt There Any Relative That Would Have The recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Phoebe: Oh No-No, No, I Made A Promise To Myself That The Next Time I Would Talk To Ursula Would Be Over My Dead Body. And Thats Not Happening Til October 15Th, 2032.
Ross: Thats The Day Youre Gonna Die? Seedarnit, Ive Got shuffleboard that day.
Phoebe: Thats what you think.
Monica: Well, I Mean What About Friends Of Your Grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?
Phoebe: Well, Yknow I May Have Relatives In France Who Would Know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Monica: What was her name?
Phoebe: Nesele Toulouse.
Monica: Nestle Tollhouse?!
Phoebe: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Monica: (Grabbing A Bag Of Nestle Tollhouse Chocolate Chips) Phoebe, Is This the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
Phoebe: (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
Monica: I Cannot Believe That I Just Spent The Last Two Days Trying To Figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Phoebe: I Know! You See It Is Stuff Like This Which Is Why (Looking Down) Youre Burning In Hell!! [Scene: The Gym, Chandler and Mr. Geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]
Chandler: So You Understand, Id Feel A Lot More Comfortable If You Didnt Tell People What Happened. Yknow, Im A Littleim A little embarrassed about it.
Mr. Geller: I Understand Completely, Theres Nothing More Horrifying Than Embarrassing Yourself In Front Of Your In-Laws. As A Matter Of Fact, When I Started Dating Judy I Was Unemployed, And Her Father Asked Me What I Did For A Living And I Told Him I was a lawyer.
Chandler: What did you do when they found out?
Mr. Geller: They Never Did, So If Ever See Me Giving Them Legal Advice Just Nod Along. Shall We?  (Chandler Nods Along And They Enter The Whirlpool Room And Remove Their Robes. Only Chandler Is Lacking A Certain Item Of Clothing. You See This Is A Coed Whirlpool, Which Means Swimsuits, And In Fact There Are Two Women Already There And Chandler Didnt seem to wear his. Needless to say, everyone is shocked, including Chandler.)
Chandler: So I Guess We Wear Swimsuits In Here! Ending Credits [Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; Joey and Rachel are relaxing.]
Rachel: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, why dont you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)
Rachel: Ohh were not sailing.
Joey: Just pull on it.
Rachel: All Right. (She Does So And It Brings The Cooler Closer Together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whats in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
Joey: What else?
Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.
Joey: Thank you.
Rachel: Oh Wow! (She Takes A Bite, But Holds The Sandwich Vertically So That The stuff falls out.)
Joey: What are you doing?
Rachel: Ohh, sorry.
Joey: What Youdont Hold It Like That! Youre Lettin All The Good Stuff Fall Out. (More falls out.)
Rachel: Ohh whoops.
Joey: Careful! Youre Wasting Good Pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh My God! Im My dad!
