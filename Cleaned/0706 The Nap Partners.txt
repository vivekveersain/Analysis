Not Like Joey Is At One End And Ross Is On The Other, They Both Happen To Be Lying Down And Sleeping Together. Well, There Hasnt Been Any Clothes Removed So Not That Kind Of Sleeping Together. Not That Theres Anything Wrong With That. That Is Unless Youre A Republican In Which That Kind Of Thing Will Bring About The Downfall Of Western Society, Especially If They Should Happen To Want To Get Married. Anyway, Let Me Recap. No, There Is Too Much, Let Me Sum Up. Ross And Joey Are Taking A Nap Together On Top Of Each Other And Both Wake-Up At the same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]

Monica: Chandler! (Knocks On The Door.) Chandler! I Just Figured Out Who You are!
Chandler: Can you figure out what Im doing?
Monica: Youre Lewis Posin.
Chandler: Who?
Monica: Lewis Posin! He Was My Best Friend In Fifth Grade, And-And Then One Day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Chandler: Because You Kept Talking To Him While He Was Trying To Go To The bathroom?!
Monica: No! But Because He Thought I Was To Faaaaa. (Chandler Emerges, Without Flushing By The Way.) And Every Time I Think About It, It Makes Me Feel As Bad As I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Chandler: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica: No, I Know. But Yknow What? It Would Make Me Feel Better If Lewis apologized to me.
Chandler: Okay, I Will Do It. But I Have To Warn You; This May Make Me A Better Person And That Is Not The Man You Feel In Love With! [Scene: Joey And Rachel'S, Joey And Ross Are Laying Out The Ground Rules For The Maid of honor auditions to Rachel and Phoebe.]
Joey: Okay, All Right, This Is How Its Going To Work. Were Gonna Give You Hypothetical Maid Of Honor Situations And You Will Be Scored On A Scale Of 1 To 10, 1 being the highest.
Ross: No, 10 is the highest.
Joey: Why is 10 the highest?
Ross: Because Its The Highest. (Joey Shrugs His Shoulders) Okay, Rachel Youre Up First. (Rachel Stands Up And Gets Ready.) Situation No. 1: Youre With Monica, The Wedding Is About To Start When Monica Gets Cold Feet. Go! (Joey Is Playing The part of Monica.)
Joey: (crying) I dont want to marry Chandler!
Rachel: Okay, uh
Joey: Ive got cold feet.
Rachel: its gonna be okay!
Joey: No, One Man For The Rest Of My Life? I Dont Know If I Can Do It! This means Ill never get to sleep with Joey!
Rachel: Look Monica, Getting Cold Feet Is Very Common. Yknow, Its-Its Just Because Of All The Anticipation And You Just Have To Remember That You Love Chandler. And Also, I Ran Out On A Wedding. You Dont Get To Keep The gifts.

Chandler: As Bad As That Went I Actually Enjoyed Myself. I Think That Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.

Chandler: I would really love it if could do both.
Monica: All right, II have to ask.
Chandler: What?
Monica: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Chandler: What?!
Monica: Well, You Broke Up With Julie Grath! How Much Weight Could She Have gained?
Chandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Monica: In One Year?! My God What Did She Eat? Her-Her Family! Thats Not the point.
Chandler: Look I Know It Was A Stupid Reason To Break Up With Somebody, But I was 15!
Monica: Well Thats Not The Only Time This Was An Issue. You Remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Chandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica: How?
Chandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica: What If I Have Babies, Okay? I Mean Im Gonna Look Different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!
