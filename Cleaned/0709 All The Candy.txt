Chandler: That Sounds Like My First Bike. (They All Turn And Look At Him.) My dad gave me his old one.
Ross: Ohh.
Monica: Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Phoebe: No! But She Gave Me The Box That It Came In. It Had A Picture Of The Bike On The Front. (Theyre All Speechless) So I Would Sit On It And My Step-Dad would drag me around the backyard.
Ross: That is so unfair!
Phoebe: Not Really, I Got To Drag Him Around Too! (They All Nod, "Oh.") Opening Credits [Scene: Monica, Chandler, And Phoebe'S, Monica Is Cooking, Joey Is Eating, And Chandler is entering from the bedroom.]

When Asked If You Take Initiative I Wrote, "Yes, He Was Able To Unhook My Bra With Minimal Supervision," And Under Problems With Performance I Wrote, "Dear God, I Hope Not," And Then Uh, Then I Drew A Little Smiley Face, And Then A Small Pornographic Sketch. [Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Monica, Ross, And Chandler Are Watching Phoebe Polish The daisies on her bike outside.]
Monica: Ross! That Is So Sweet Of You To Get Phoebe That Bike! When I Heard The story, I almost cried.

Monica: See, This Is Why I Told You Never Get Involved With Your Assistant! And Here Is No Such Thing As Keeping Secrets When It Comes To Affairs. (To Chandler) Did You hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Chandler: (with his mouth full) What happened? Im just eating candy.
Rachel: Maybe Its Not As Bad As I Think. Yknow, Maybe They didnt take it the way I meant it.
Chandler: Absolutely! Yknow, Because Touchie Can Mean Both Ass And Good worker.
Rachel: Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Joey: Hey Rach?

The Woman: I told em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Monica: Some People Have Been Saying Its Yknow Little Drops Of Heaven, But whatever.

Monica: (Still Talking To The Woman) All Right, Ill Do It Just This Once! But you cant tell anybody!
The Woman: (exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!

Joey and Chandler: Yeah, thats her.
The Woman: (after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.

Chandler: Yknow what would work?
Monica: Hmm?
Chandler: Stop making candy!
Monica: But they like it!
Chandler: You mean they like you.
Monica: Maybe.
Chandler: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Monica: Oh, You Really Want To Talk About Getting People To Like You Huh, Funny Man? (Joey Laughs But Stops When Chandler Turns To Glare At Him.) [Scene: Central Park, Ross is teaching Phoebe how to ride her bike.]

Monica: (Opening The Door And Frantically) Okay, Guys! The Candy Is Coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All: We Want Candy! We Want Candy Now! (And Other General Commotion sounds.)
Chandler: All Right Everybody! Just Be Quiet! Be Quiet! Be Quiet!! Pipe-Pipe-Pipe Down! (They Settle Down) What Is The Matter With You People?! This Woman Was Trying To Do A Nice Thing For You. She Was Making Candy So She Could Try To Get To know all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?

Monica: Did you smoke?
Chandler: No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady Blew Smoke Directly Into My Mouth. Eh-uhare you okay?
Monica: Im Fine Now, But It Was Really Scary There For A While. I Mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Joey: (With His Mouth Full) Oh Yeah, Sorry About That. Mob Mentality Or Whatever, I Dont Know (Grabs The Note.) Ending Credits [Scene: Central Park, Phoebe Is Now Riding Her Bike With Ease And Stops In Front Of Ross. They both giggle.]
Phoebe: I Cant Believe It! I Did It! I Rode A Bike! I Never Thought Id be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Ross: Oh Hey, Dont Thank Me, Thank Yourself. Youre The One Who Faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Phoebe: Dont Be So Corny Ross, Its Not An After-School Special. (She Rides Off And The Camera Pans Down To Reveal Two Shiny, Silver Training Wheels Firmly attached.)
