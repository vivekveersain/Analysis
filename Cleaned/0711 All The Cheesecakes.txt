 [Scene: Chandler And Monicas, Chandler Is Sitting At The Kitchen Table Eating cheesecake. The box it came in is also on the table.]
Chandler: Ohh. Mmm.
Rachel: (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
Chandler: Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Rachel: Oh, Yknow I'M Not That Much Of A Sweet Tooth. I(Chandler Puts A Forkful Of The Cheesecake In Her Mouth.)Wow. My God, So Creamy. Oh My God, This Is The Best Cheesecake I Have Ever Had. Where Did You Get This? (She Reaches Over To look at the label on the box.)
Chandler: (Nervously) It Was At The Front Door. When I Got Home. Somebody Sent it to us.
Rachel: Chandler, This Is Not Addressed To You. This Is Addressed To Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.
Chandler: Ino! I Didn'T Read The Box Before I Opened It. And You Can'T return a box after you've opened the box.
Rachel: Why, why not?
Chandler: Because it's too delicious.
Rachel: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Chandler: No-No-No! It Is Going To Be Okay, Because Mrs. Braverman Is Gonna Send Away For A Free One And That Way We All Win! The Only Losers Are The Big Cheesecake Conglomerate, (Reading The Label) Mommas Little Bakery. (Pause) I Feel Terrible, Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Rachel: (Taking A Bite) Oh, Im Sorry What? Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, Everyone Except Rachel Is There As Joey Gets Up And Starts putting on his coat.]
Joey: All Right, I Should Get Going, Big Day A Work. Yknow Im In A coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead.
Chandler: So
Joey: Ah-Ah-Ah Mr. Smartie Pants, Its Just Not My Character Thats not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Phoebe: Absolutely!
Joey: Ill see you at 8:00.
Phoebe: Okay. (Joey exits.) 
Chandler: Oh, whats at 8:00?
Phoebe: Oh, I Have Dinner Plans With Joey. We Get Together About Once A Month To discuss the rest of you guys.
Ross: Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Phoebe: Duly noted.
Ross: Thanks. (Phoebe Gets Up To Get A Refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So For Tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica: What are you talking about?
Ross: Cousin Frannies wedding, its tomorrow night.
Monica: You were invited?!
Ross: No.
Monica: My God, I Cant Believe This! I Mean I Knew That Mom And Dad Were Invited, But I Thought That Was It! I Mean From The Ages 7 To 9 Frannie And I Were inseparable!
Chandler: Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.
Ross: Well L-Look Okay, Its Probably Just A Mistake. Let Me Call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Monica: Yeah, Well You Call Her And Tell Her That Yknow When We Were Kids Her Precious Little Frannie Tried To Undress Me Several Times, Okay? And If I Hadnt have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too.
Ross: Yknow, she tried to undress me too.
Chandler: I Used To Undress My Cousin Glenn. (Monica Looks At Him Then Sushes Him.) [Scene: Joey And Rachel'S, Monica, Chandler, Rachel, And Ross Are Playing Monopoly as Phoebe enters angrily.]
Phoebe: Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Rachel: Umm, I think hes still out. Whats wrong?
Phoebe: Well, Ill Tell You Rachel Karen Green, I Had Plans With Joey tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)
Rachel: (Reading The Note) "Pheebs, Cant Make It, Got A Date. Talk To you later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?
Phoebe: Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.
Ross: Hey, Yknow What Nickname Never Caught On? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica shakes her head in disgust.)
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Oh! Heres Joseph Francis!
Joey: Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Phoebe: So what?! That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!
Joey: Hey, You Can Cancel Plans With Friends If There Is The Possibility For sex!
Ross: Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.
Phoebe: I Dont Accept This Rule. When Me Make Plans, I Expect You To Show Up. Okay, I Cant Just Be A Way To Kill Time Til You Meet Someone Better! Yknow Boyfriends And Girlfriends Come And Go, But This (Motions That Their friendship) is for life!
Joey: Wow! Im so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Phoebe: Well, it does.
Joey: Okay, Can I-Can I Make It Up To You? Huh? Im Sorry. (They Hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! Ill pay for myself!
Phoebe: Okay, you wore me down.
Ross: Hey Joe, While Youre Over There How About Another Beer For The Ross-A-Tron?
Joey: The Rossis That Back?!! (Chandler Motions No.) [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S, Rachel Enters To Find Chandler Staring At Another cheesecake box.]
Rachel: Hi!
Chandler: Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Rachel: So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
Chandler: I cant seem to say goodbye.
Rachel: Are You Serious?! Chandler, We Ate An Entire Cheesecake Two Days Ago And you want more?
Chandler: Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Rachel: It Was Cheesecake. It Was Fine. It Had A Buttery, Crumbly, Graham Cracker Crust, With A Very Rich Yet Light, Cream Cheese Filling (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva! 
Chandler: (Closing The Box) Yknow What? Forget It! We Are Just Hungry! We Have Not Had Lunch! We Are Just Light-Headed! So Let Us Go Out And Have Lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Rachel: Yeah And Well Drop It Off Downstairs So That Were Not tempted.
Chandler: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?

Joey: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Ross: So I Finally Heard Back From Aunt Sheryl And Apparently It Wasnt a mistake. Ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.
Monica: Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
Ross: Well Yeah, But She Doesnt Know That. I Mean, The Last Time She Saw you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. 
Monica: (Disgusted) Limited Seating! Oh, That Is Such A Lame Excuse! Thats not the reason shes not inviting me!
Ross: Oh Whats The Big Deal?! I Wasnt Even Invited To The Ceremony, Just The Reception. And-And Yknow What? If It Makes You Feel Any Better, Joan And I Will Just Make An Appearance And Then, And Then Well-Well Leave Early As A sign of protest.
Monica: Joan?
Ross: Yeah, Joan Tedeski My Date. Shes An Assistant Professor In The Linguistics Department. Tall, Very Beautiful, And Despite What Some People Say, Not broad backed!
Monica: Wait A Minute, You Got Ross Gellar And Guest?! I Wasnt Invited And you got "and guest?!"

Chandler: So Apparently We Just Dont Pay For Food Anymore. (Rachel Laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?
Rachel: (Gasps) Its Still There! (The Cheesecake They Returned To Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)
Chandler: Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
Rachel: She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
Chandler: By Then, The Cheesecake May Have Gone Bad. We Dont Want Her To come back to bad cheesecake.
Rachel: No that could kill her.
Chandler: Well, we dont want that.
