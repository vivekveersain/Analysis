When You Get In There (Joey Nods His Disapproval.) [Scene: Phoebes Apartment Building, In Desperation She Has Wrapped Up The Smoke detector in a blanket and is going to throw it into the trash chute.]
Phoebe: Okay, This Is Where You And I Part Ways. (She Drops The Blanket Into The Chute.) Noisy Bitch! [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S Bedroom, Chandler Is Turning On The Light To Awaken A Now sleeping Monica.]

Rachel: Well Yeah, I Wish That You Would. (He Opens The Top Drawer.) Well, No Its Not In There! (Closes It.) How About That Drawer? (She Points To The Bottom One and he opens it. She doesnt see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
Tag: Well, Its Not Out Here. Is There Any Chance It Could Be In Your office?
Rachel: (Thinks) Yknow, I Dont-I Dont Know. Let Me, Let Me Check. (As She Heads For Her Office, She Stops Glances Over Her Should At Tag, Looks Into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
Tag: (smirking) Any luck?

[Scene: Phoebe'S Apartment, There Is Someone Pounding On The Door And Phoebe Sleepily Walks Over And Answers It. As She Nears The Door, The Pounding Stops And She Can Hear The smoke detectors wail.]
Phoebe: Oh my God! How did you get back here?!

A Disembodied Voice: (yelling through the door) Phoebe Buffay?!
Phoebe: (Scared) Fire Alarm? (She Opens The Door To Reveal A Fireman Holding The blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
The Fireman: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Phoebe: Thats not mine.
The Fireman: Yes it is.
Phoebe: How do you know?
The Fireman: The Next Time You Want To Dump A Fire Alarm In A Trash Chute, Dont Wrap It In A Blanket That Says, "Property Of Phoebe Buffay Not Monica."
Phoebe: Okay Do Youokay, Do You Have A Search Warrant? Because The Last time I checked this was still America!
The Fireman: Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
Phoebe: Fine! (She Takes The Blanket.) But Please God; Tell Me How To Stop Them from going off!
The Fireman: Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
Phoebe: Theres A Reset Button?! Ugh, Thank You! Thank You! (He Exits And She Goes To Shut It Off.) Theres A Reset Button! My God! Why Didnt I See That! (She Takes Off The Plastic Cover And Looks For The Button.) Reset Button, Reset Button, Where Is There A Reset Button? (Finds It.) Oh Here It Is! (Picks It Up Off Of The Floor.) Oh! (She Presses It Hard, But Of Course It Would Help If The Button Was Still Attached To The Detector. In Frustration She Presses It So Hard It Causes Pain In Her Thumb.) Ohh, God! [Scene: The Fire Escape, Joey Is Now Hanging Off Of The Bottom Rung Of The Ladder That wont move and Ross is watching from above.]

Joey: All Right.  (Ross steps onto the bottom rung of the ladder and then steps on Joeys chest.)
Joey: (grunting) Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
Ross: I Prefer Not To Answer That Right Now, Im Still Carrying A Little Holiday Weight. (Ross Continues To Climb Down. He Puts His Other Foot Further Down On Joeys Torso, But That Doesnt Work Very Well And Hes Forced To Wrap His Legs Around Joey. Which then forces Joey to get a nice and close view of Rosss crotch.)
Joey: Yknow, When We Talked About Face To Face, I Dont Think We thought it all the way through.
Ross: So what do you want me to do?
Joey: Well, Just Shimmy Down Me And Drop! (Ross continues his trek south, and when they get face to face.)
Ross: Hi.
Joey: Hi.
Ross: (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Joey: (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Ross: Its still looks pretty far!
Joey: Its not that far! Just drop!
Ross: Do Not Rush Me!! (Ross continues south and his now wrapped around Joeys legs.)
Joey: Ross, You Should Know That My Pants Are Startin To Come Down And Im Not Wearing Any Underwear! (Ross panics and falls off, dropping to the ground with a huge crash.)

Chandler: Well, Youre Not Gonna Believe This, But If You Have Seven minutes
