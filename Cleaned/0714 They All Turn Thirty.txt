 [Scene: Joey And Rachel'S, Joey Is Knocking On Rachels Door, Whose Door Frame Is Decorated With Balloons. The Rest Of The Gang Is There As Well. Rachel Opens The Door And the gang blow on noisemakers.]
Ross: Happy birthday!!!
Monica: Happy Birthday!!! (Rachel glares at them and goes back into her room, closing her door.)
All: Rach! Come on! Rach!
Monica: Its your birthday!
Tag: (entering from her room) Hey.
Chandler: (To Monica) Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Tag: Ms. Green Would Like To Establish Some Ground Rules Before She Comes Out. She Would Appreciate It If You Dont Use The Words Old Or Downhill Or (To Joey) They still look pretty damn good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)
Joey: They do!
Phoebe: Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Monica: Chocolate-Chip Pancakes! (There is no response from Rachel.)
Ross: Weve Got Presents! (She opens the door.)
Rachel: Good ones?
Monica: They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Rachel: Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Joey: Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Ross: Oh Really. Is That How You Felt When You Turned Thirty? [Flashback To Joeys Thirtieth Birthday Party. It Is Being Held In Monica And Chandlers apartment.]
Joey: (Screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We Had A Deal!! Let The Others Grow Old! Not Me!! (He Buries His Head In Phoebes Lap For Comfort.) [Cut back to Rachels party, everyone is now eating breakfast, except Rachel.]
Rachel: Yknow, Im still 29 in Guam.
Ross: Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Rachel: Late Thirties? Oh Come On You Guys! Is It Just Me? Am I Overreacting To this?
Chandler: No Rach, Its Not Just You. My Thirtieth Birthday Certainly Wasnt That Much Fun. [Flashback To Chandlers Thirtieth Birthday Party. It Is Also Being Held In Monica and his apartment. He is about to blow out the candles on his birthday cake.]
Joey: (Screaming) And Now Chandler! Were All Gettin So Old! (Looking Up) Why Are You Doing This To Us?! (Turns Away Crying.) Opening Credits [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, breakfast is finished but Rachels still down.]
Monica: Rach, Youre In A Great Place In Your Life. Come On, Youve got a great job! Good friends
Joey: Yeah, youre roommate is a soap opera star.
Rachel: Look, Yknow I Know My Lifes Going Pretty Well, But I Look Around And I Just See So Many People Whove Accomplished So Many Other Goals By The time theyre thirty.
Phoebe: Yeah, But You Shouldnt Compare Yourself To Me. [Flashback To: The Street In Front Of Central Perk, Ross And Joey Are Holding A Yellow Tape Across The Road And Everyone Is Cheering Phoebe As She Bounces Around The Corner On A hippity-hop.]
All: Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Rachel: There You Go! (She crosses the line and they all cheer again.)
Phoebe: I Did It! One Mile On A Hippity-Hop! Thats It!! Thats Everything I Wanted To Do Before I Was Thirty. Oh, Except I Wanted To Patch Things Up With My Sister. But Oh Well. Yay!! (They All Cheer Again.) And-And Girls This Thing Is A Godsend If You Know What I Mean. (Rachel And Monica Look Intrigued And As They All Head Into Central Perk, Rachel Picks Up The Hippity-Hop That Phoebe Left Behind.) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Rachel: Thirty. Ugh, I Mean Thirty! Monica, Do You Remember Mean, Old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Tag: Come On, Lets Have Some Fun. Huh? (To Rachel) What Do You Want To Do today?
Rachel: Nothing. I dont want to do anything.
Monica: Well, Doing Nothing On Your Thirtieth Is Better Than Doing Something stupid, like Ross.
Ross: Hey! That Was A Practical Purchase! I Needed That Car For Transportation! Okay? I-I Have A Child! [Flashback To: A Street, Ross Is Sitting In His Newly Purchased Mgb. Which Is One Of The Better British Sports Cars Ever Made. Of Course, Better Is A Relative Term. Which Reminds Me Of A Joke. Why Dont The British Make Computers? Because They Couldnt Figure Out How To Make Them Leak Oil. Anyway, The Gang Is All staring at his new purchase.]
Ross: How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Chandler: Ross, A Sports Car? Wouldnt It Have Been Cheaper To Just Stuff A sock down there?
Ross: Thats Not What This Is About Okay? I-I Am A Sports Car Enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Joey: Hey, whats the horsepower on this thing?
Ross: (giddy) I dont know, but-but look how shiny!
Monica: I cant believe you bought this.
Rachel: Really! God Ross, What Were You Thinking? (To Phoebe, Quietly) I Know its really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Phoebe: Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?
Ross: Hop In. (Phoebe Hops In.) Get Ready For The Smoothest Ride Of Your Life.  (He Starts The Car And Surprisingly In Fires Right Up And Comes To A Nice Idle. (Both Can Be Rarities With British Sports Cars With Their Lovely Lucas Ignition Systems, Which Tend Not To Work Especially In The Rain.) Anyway, This Being New York He Is Parallel Parked On A Street With The Car In Front Of Him Only Inches Ahead Of His Bumper, Likewise With The Car Behind Him. Hes Completely Boxed In And Cant Move More Than Two Inches. He Tries To Get Out Several Times By Bumping The Bumpers Of Both Cars To No avail.)
Ross: Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
Phoebe: (Getting Out) Okay, Whos Next? [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is pouring Rachel some coffee.]
Rachel: Yknow What? I Am Going To Do Something Today. Im Not Just Gonna Sit Around Like Some Old Lady. Im Gonna Get Something Pierced. Like My Uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Phoebe: Really?! Cause yknow that hurts.
Rachel: So What?! Yknow What? The Way I See It(Phoebe Pulls Out A hair from the back of her head)Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Tag: Look Rachel, I Know What Youre Going Through. Im Totally freaked about turning 25.
Rachel: (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment. 
Monica: All Right Rach, For What Its Worth, I Think That Youre Doing great. I mean yknow lets face it, no one handles this well.
Phoebe: Least of all you.
Tag: Why? What youd do?
Monica: Werent You Asked To Leave Sonny? [Flashback To Monica And Chandlers Apartment. Chandler Has A Bunch Of People Over In Formal Wear To Give Monica A Surprise Birthday Party. Joey Is Coming Out Of The bathroom and removing his tie.]
Chandler: (To Joey) Would You Put That Back On?! Monicas Gonna Be Here Any minute!
Joey: But it hurts my Joeys Apple.
Chandler: (Frustrated) Okay, For The Last Time. Its Not Named For Each Individual Man. (Joey Walks Away And Mr. And Mrs. Geller Walk Up. Mr. Geller Is Wearing This Ancient velvet tuxedo.)
Mrs. Geller: (To Chandler) Youve Done A Wonderful Job With This Party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Chandler: Oh Well, Not As Lovely As You. I Mean, I Cant Believe That You Would Have A Thirty-Year-Old Daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And You! I Cant Believe That You Would Have A Tux Thats Thirty Years Old! (Puts His Hand On Mr. Gellers shoulder.)
Mr. Geller: Its Older Than That. Ross Was Actually Conceived Right Near this tuxedo.
Chandler: Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! Shes coming!
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Everybody Down! Everybody Down! (Rachel Turns Off The Lights And Everyone Crouches. As Everyone Crouches, A Ripping Noise Erupts From The assemblage.)
Mr. Geller: Crap. (We hear some fumbling at the door, then silence.)
Chandler: (Getting Up To Investigate) Okay, Everybody Stay Here. I Will Find Out Whats Going On. (He Goes Out Into The Hall And Finds A Very Drunk Monica Lying Up Against Joey And Rachels door.)
Monica: Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)
Chandler: Hey-hey are you drunk?
Monica: Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She Tries To Pull Herself Up By Rachel And Joeys Doorknob, But The Door Opens And She Almost Falls Into The Their Apartment. She Manages To Catch Herself.) Whoa!

She Inserts The Device, Unlocks The Door, Opens It, And The Alarm Goes Off.) Haul Ass!!!! (Runs Off.) (The Rest Of The Gang Runs Away, Except For Ross Whos Tramped Inside His Car. To Hide He Puts The Top Up As Monica, Rachel, And Joey Come Running Past.) [Scene: Phoebes Birthday, Shes Taking The Hippity-Hop To Ursulas apartment as a gift.

Chandler: No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Rachel: (crying) No, I know! I get it! Its funny!

Rachel: Okay! Yknow What? I Realized It Was Stupid To Get Upset About Not Having A Husband And Kids. All I Really Needed Was A Plan. See I Wanna Have Three kids
Phoebe: Oh Let Me Guess, And You Wanna Have Them All At The Same Time And You wanna have them for your brother.
Rachel: As I Was Saying I Should Probably Have The First Of The Three Kids By The Time Im 35 Which Gives Me Five Years. I Love This Plan! I Wanna Marry This plan!
Phoebe: If you could do that, Id marry the hippity-hop.
Rachel: So, If I Wanna Have My Kid When Im 35, I Dont Have To Get Pregnant Until Im 34. Which Gives Prada Four Years To Start Making Maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant
Monica: Really! That Long?! (Chandler Slowly Turns And Looks At Her.) (To Chandler) Look all you want, its happening!
Rachel: No, So I Dont Have To Get Married Until Im 33! Thats Three Years, Thats Three Whole Yearsoh, Wait A Minute Though. Ill Need A Year And A Half To Plan The Wedding, And Id Like To Know The Guy For A Year, Year And A Half Before We Get Engaged Which Means I Need To Meet The Guy By The Time Im thirty.
