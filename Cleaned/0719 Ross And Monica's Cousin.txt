Chandler: I Was Not Staring At Her. Okay? I Was Just Listening Intently. Its Called Being A Good Conversationalist. Watch. (Stares At Monicas Eyes.) Say something.
Monica: You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Ross: Fine, She Can Stay At My Place. By The Way, What-What Does Cassie Even look like now.
Monica: She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Chandler: Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Monica: Wafer Thin Ice! [Scene: A Casting Directors Office, Joey is entering for his callback.]
Joey: Hey, Im back!
The Casting Director: Hi-hi Joey.

Joey: Oh Great! Yknow I Wouldve Been Perfect For This Part, But Whatever! Yknow, Thanks For Making A Bad Decision And Ruining Your Movie! Good Day! (Starts to leave.)
The Casting Director: Wait Joey! You Didnt Need To Come Down Because The director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Joey: And Scene! Huh? Wasnt That Fun? We Did A Little Improv There. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
The Casting Director: Well, The Director Thinks Youre Really Right For The part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Joey: Wow! Sure! Thats great!
The Casting Director: Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Joey: Yeah! Yeah Sure, Just Long As Its Handled Tastefully And That Barn is not too cold.
The Casting Director: Terrific! Well Uh, Theres One More Thing. Uhh, Uh Its Really Important To The Director That Everything In This Movie Is Authentic. Yeah And So In Your Love Scene With Sarah She Talks About How Shes Never Seen A naked man who wasnt Jewish. So (Laughs.)
Joey: SoWhat?
The Casting Director: So Uh Well The Director Is Insisting That Whoever Play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what Im saying?
Joey: Yes!
The Casting Director: Okay.
Joey: No. What?

Joey: Yep.
Monica: But you told them you werent?
Joey: Thats right.
Monica: Wow! Wow! And Its Definitely All Gone? Theres Nothing There to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?
Joey: I Dont Know! I Really Want This Part! And They Tell You No Matter What You Get Asked At An Audition You Say Yes. Like If-If They Want You To Ride A Horse, you tell em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Monica: Joey! This Is Not Like Learning To Ride A Horse! This Is Like Learning togrow a turtleneck!
Joey: I Kn-I Know! I Know! Okay? And Apparently Tomorrow When I Go In To Meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Monica: Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Joey: I Just Have To Call My Agent And Tell Her I Cant Do The Part. (Gets up for the phone.)
Monica: Unless!
Joey: Unless what?
Monica: Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.

 (They Exchange Looks, Smile, And Shrug Their Shoulders Before Ross Suddenly Lunges forward in an attempt to kiss her, but she expertly backs away.)
Cassie: Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)
Ross: (In His Head) Say Something Clever! (Pause.) Okay, Doesnt Have To Be Clever, It Just Has To Be Words. Say Some Words. (Pause) Any Words Will Do. (Pause) Oh My God!
