Joey: Yeah, You Got A Couple Hours? Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk, Rachel Is There As Ross Enters With His All His Hair Sticking straight up.]
Ross: Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Rachel: Take the top down did ya?
Ross: Only Way To Fly. (Rachel laughs.)
Rachel: Come On Ross Give Me The Keys! Monica Does Not Know What shes talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Ross: Youre fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Rachel: Well In High School, That Added Up To Head Cheerleader. (A woman walks by and smiles at Rosss hair.)
Ross: Did You See The Look That Girl Just Gave Me? Huh? She Mustve Seen Me cruising in the bad boy.
Rachel: I think shes checking out your beehive Ross.
Ross: What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
Rachel: Gimme the keys!
Ross: No way!
Rachel: Well no brush!
Ross: Fine! Yknow What? It Doesnt Matter, Because, If I Remember Correctly, There Is A Comb On The Floor Of The Bathroom.  (He Goes To The Bathroom And After He Leaves Rachel Goes Through His Coat And Grabs The keys along with a $20 bill. The woman from before watches her do this.)
Rachel: (To The Woman) Alimony. (Runs Outside.) [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S, Monica And Phoebe Are Counting The Invitations As Chandler exits from the bathroom.]
Monica: Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Chandler: Oh! Right. Umm, Maybe Thats Because I Didnt Send Him An invitation.
Monica: Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
Chandler: I Dont Even Know The Man. Okay? Were Not The Close. I havent seen him in years.
Monica: Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
Chandler: Well He Doesnt Have To Know! Its Not Like We Run In The same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Phoebe: Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Chandler: Trust Me, You Dont Want Him There Either. Okay? Nobody Is Gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Monica: So What! As Long As Hes Not Wearing A White Dress And A Veil I dont care.
Phoebe: Okay, I Think I Need To Do Some Shopping. (Gets Up And Leaves.) [Scene: A Street, Rachel is throwing her coat into the Porsche and getting in.]
Rachel: Ahhh! (Gets In.) Ooh, Nice! (Suddenly from out of nowhere Ross dives onto the hood.)
Rachel: My God!
Ross: What do you think youre doing?!
Rachel: Just Washing The Windshield. (She Turns On The Wipers Forcing Ross Off of the hood.)
Ross: There Is No Way I Am Letting You Drive This Car! So Why Dont you just hand over the keys?
Rachel: Oh. {Transcribers Note: She Puts The Key Into The Ignition, Which Is On The Left Side Of The Steering Wheel. Does Anyone Know Why That Is? Its A Tradition Left Over From Porsches Racing History. The Worlds Greatest Endurance Race Is The 24 Hours Of Lemans. Which Is In France And Runs For 24 Hours Straight From Noon On Saturday Through The Dark Of Night And Finishes At Noon On Sunday. In The 60S Lemans Had A Unique Start Where The Drivers Would Actually Start The Race Outside Of The Car And Across The Track. At The Start Of The Race, The Drivers Would Run Across The Track, Get In The Car, Buckle Up, Start The Car, And Drive Off. Porsche Wanted To Reduce The Amount Of Time That Took. Since All Cars To That Point Had The Ignition Switches On The Right Side Of The Steering Wheel, That Required The Drivers To Use Their Right Hand To Grab The Seat-Belts, Put The Car In Gear And Start It. The Drivers Left Hand Did Nothing. Porsche In Order To Save A Few Seconds In A 24-Hour Race; Moved The Ignition Switches To The Left Side Of The Steering Wheel So That The Driver Could Start The Car With His Left Hand While Grabbing The Seat-Belts With His Right Hand. Thats Why Every Porsche Car Built Since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}
Ross: No Ah-Ah-Ah! Do Not Start This Car! (She Starts The Car.) Okay! Okay! I Will Give You Twenty Bucks If You Get Out Of This Car Right Now! (He Looks For The twenty Rachel stole and doesnt find it.)
Rachel: Look Ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car!
Ross: With you?! Yeah right!
Rachel: All right. (She starts off.)
Ross: (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)
Rachel: What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Ross: In the death seat?!!
Rachel: Oh My (They Drive Off.) [Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are on the couch as a man enters.]
Man: Hey guys!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey sweetie!
Man: Ready to go?
Phoebe: Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I Left My Purse Up At Monicas. Ill Be Right back. (She goes to get it.)
Man: (stopping her) Wait a minute!
Phoebe: What? (He Leans In To Kiss Her.) Oh. (They Kiss And Phoebe Pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
Joey: So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Man: Over a month.
Joey: Wow! Maybe Uh, Maybe You And I Ought To Get To Know Each Other A Little better.
Man: Sure, Id like that.
Joey: So uh, whats your name?
Man: (laughs) Its Jake.
Joey: Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Jake: Yeah, big fan.
Joey: Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Jake: Yeah That Would Be Great! Let Me Make Sure Im Not Doing Anything Tuesday. (He Bends Over To Open His Bag, When He Does So His Pants Slide Down His Butt Revealing A Pink Lace Secret.) [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S, Monica Is Entering From The Bedroom Carrying Two Bags Of luggage.]
Monica: Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)

Chandler: Are You Serious?! I Mean Like Eloping?! No More Stupid Wedding Stuff?! No More These Flowers Or These Flowers Or These Flowersthink Of The Money Well Save!! (Monica Just Looks At Him.) Were Not Eloping. I Love The Flowers. Can Our wedding be bigger please?
Monica: Were Going To Las Vegas To See Your Dad. Its Time You Two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Chandler: Yknow we already went over this and I won!
Monica: No You Didnt. Oh And Honey Just So You Know, Now That Youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore.
Chandler: Look Forget It Okay? I Dont Want To Go. I Dont Want To See him. I dont wanna.
Monica: Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know
Chandler: No-No All Kids Are Embarrassed By Their Parents, Youd Have To Come Up With A Whole New Word For What I Went Through.
