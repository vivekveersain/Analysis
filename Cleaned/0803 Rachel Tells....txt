If That Happens At Another Building That I Manage, People Are Gonna Start Asking Questions. (To The Fireman) Come On! Hurry Up. (With a final swing the door gives way.)
Phoebe: Oh! We Could Have Done That. [Scene: The Airport, Chandler And Monica Are Following The Previous Couple Through A Tiny Hallway That Proves This Is A Set On A Sound Stage And Not An Actual Airport, And See them enter the first class lounge.]
