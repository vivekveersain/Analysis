Ross: Well, why dont you correct him?
Chandler: Oh Its Been Going On Way To Long Now. Yknow, I Mean The First Time He Said It We Were Just Passing Each Other In The Hallway, So I Didnt Say Anything. And Then The Next Time He Said, "Hey Toby, Do You Want A Donut?" And I-I Wanted A Donut. And Now Its Five Years Later, The Donuts Gone And Im still Toby.
Ross: Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Chandler: No! That Would Be So Awkward! Lookbesides, We Work In Different Departments. Hes On The Sixth Floor Yknow? So He Calls Me Toby Once In A While. Whats The Big Deal? It Could Be Worse, Its Not Like Hes Calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)

Joey'S Co-Star: Drake, Ive Discovered The Reason For All Your Headaches and memory loss.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: What is it?
Joey'S Co-Star: Apparently Your Brain Transplant Was Not Entirely Successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessicas brain.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: Is it serious?
Joey'S Co-Star: Not If We Extract Tissue From The Original Host Body, Synthesize Antibodies, And Introduce Them Into Your System, Which Could Stop It From Rejecting The brain.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: Well that sounds simple enough, lets just do that.
Joey'S Co-Star: We Would, But When We Went To Exhume Jessicas Body, It Was Gone. (Dramatic music plays and Joey does a little Smell-the-fart acting.)
Director: Cut! Very nice people!
Joey: (To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
