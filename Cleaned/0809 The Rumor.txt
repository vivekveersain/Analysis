 [Scene: Joey And Rachel'S, Joey Is Reading What To Expect When Youre Expecting as Rachel enters from her bedroom.]
Joey: Hey Rach Listen, Did You Know That During Pregnancy Your Fingers Swell Up to twice their size and never go back.
Rachel: (Looking At Her Fingers) Oh Mygod! Let Me See That! (Grabs The book from him.)
Joey: (laughing) You fall for it every time!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
Rachel: Oh Pheebs Thats So Sweet(Grabs A Pair Of Pants)Ooh, those are so cute!
Phoebe: Yeah! And Look, (Grabs The Pants) See How They Expand As The Baby Grows? (Theres A Stretchy Part In Front.) And Then After The Babys Born, Theyre great for shoplifting melons.
Monica: (Entering) Oh Good Youre All Here. Thanksgiving Tomorrow, Four Oclock. (To Rachel) Oh, Guess Who I Invited. Remember That Guy Will Colbert From high school?
Rachel: No.
Monica: He Was In Rosss Classmarching Bandkinda Overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
Rachel: Wow! I Dont Remember Him. Honey, Are You Sure Youre Not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Monica: No That Was Jarred! Wow! I Havent Thought About Him In A Long Time (Stares Off Into The Distance Lost In Thought.) (Pause) Anyway, Umm Wills, Wills Here On Business And He Didnt Have A Place To Go So I invited him here.
Rachel: Oh thats nice.
Monica: Oh, And By The Way, Hes Lost A Bunch Of Weight. I Mean He Looks Goo-Ood! Okay, I Mean Really, Really Gorgeous! (Joey Clears His Throat.) I Still love Chandler.
Joey: I just want you to say it once in a while.
Monica: All Right Okay, Just So You Know, Im Not Gonna Make A Turkey This year.
Joey: What?!
Monica: Well Phoebe doesnt eat turkey
Joey: Phoebe!
Phoebe: Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals!
Joey: No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!
Monica: All Right! Okay, Its Just Phoebe. Wills Still On A Diet, Chandler Doesnt Eat Thanksgiving Food, And Rachels Having Her Aversion To poultry.
Joey: She is?
Rachel: Remember I Had To Leave The Room The Other Day When You Had That Roast chicken?
Joey: Yeah. But I Thought That Was Because I Put The Whole Thing On My Hand And made it walk across the table.
Monica: Anyway, It Just Doesnt Seem Worth It To Make A Whole Turkey For just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
Joey: But You Gotta Have Turkey On Thanksgiving! I Mean, Thanksgiving With No turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
Monica: All Right Fine! If It Means That Much To You! But Justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
Joey: No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Monica: All Right, Youre Telling Me You Can Eat An Entire Turkey In Just one sitting?
Joey: Thats Right! Cause Im A Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And This Is What We Do! I Mean We May Not Be Great Thinkers Or World Leaders, We Dont Read A Lot Or Run Very Fast, But Damnit! We Can Eat! Opening Credits [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S, Chandler Is Watching Football, And Its Actually The Right Game Green Bay At Detroit (Although Not This Years), As Monica Is Getting everything ready.]

Monica: Hey!
Will: Hey! (Oh, I Should Point Out That The Live Studio Audience At This Point Goes Absolutely Wild. And I Had Absolutely No Idea That This Will Character Was That Popular! Maybe They Should Make Him The Seventh Friend. Which Would Work Out Just Fine Since Hes Already Married To One Of Them. Will Is Played By Some Guy Named Brad Pitt, I Guess Hes Some sort of actor.)

Phoebe: Oh okay.
Chandler: Oh come on!
Phoebe: Noooo!! Damn You Ref! You Burn In Hell!!! (Joey enters eating potato chips.)
Monica: Hey, What Are You Doing? You Gotta Save Room, Youve Got Almost An entire turkey to eat.

Joey: Thats It?! Even If Nobody Helps Me I Can Eat That No Problem. At least give me a challenge!
Monica: (Laughs) This Is Chandlers Chicken. This Is The Turkey. (Sets Down a huge turkey.)
Joey: (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?

Ross: Uh Actually, There-There Was Also That Exchange Student From Thailand But I-I dont think he-he knew what it was.
Rachel: So Ross, We Went Out For Two Years, And You Never Told Me You Were In An I Hate Rachel club.
Will: You went out with her?! We had a pact!
Ross: That was in high school! Its not like it was binding forever.
Will: Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
Rachel: Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Monica: I Swear I Didnt. (To Ross And Will) Hey! Is That Why You Guys Used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?

Ross and Will: Yeah.
Monica: Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Ross: Look Rach I-Im Sorry, Okay? Ii Was A Stupid Kid, Okay? The only reason I joined
Will: Co-founded!
Ross: Co-Founded. Co-Founded The Club Was Because I Was Insanely In Love With You. Obviously I Didnt Handle It Very Well. But If You Think About It The I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Will: Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
Rachel: Okay. So What? You Guys Would Just Like Get Together And Like Just Say mean things about me?
Will: Well, we did a little more than that.

Ross: Actually, Billy Tratt Is Gay Now. So-So That Ones Not Really Our fault.
Rachel: Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Monica: I Thought It Might Be True. And I Was Afraid That You Were Gonna Cry And Then Show It To Me. (Joey Is Now Looking At Rachel, And Since Rachels Standing And Hes Sitting down and hes not looking at her face You get the picture.)
Rachel: Joey stop staring! Theres nothing there! Its not true!
Joey: Im afraid Im gonna need proof.

Joey: You are my Everest.
Monica: Joey, you dont have to finish that.
Joey: Oh Yes I Do. Otherwise Whats Next? Today Im Just A Guy Who Cant Finish A Turkey, But Tomorrow Im The Guy Who Eats Half A Powerbar, Wraps Up The Rest, And Puts In The Fridge? No! No, I Justi Justi Gotta Change my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)
Rachel: (Entering Carrying A Book) Okay! Okay! Listen To What Sean Mcmahon Wrote In My Yearbook Senior Year, "Dear Rach, Youre Such A Good Person." Not girl! Person!
Ross: Rach, I think youre reading a little too much into it.
Rachel: (Reading What He Wrote Again) "Dear Rach, Youre A Great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)
Ross: Look, What Do You Want Me To Do? Do You Want Me To Call Everyone In The entire school and tell them it wasnt true?!
Rachel: Yes!
Will: Could you also tell them Im skinny now?
Monica: Oh! Me too!

Ross: No.
Rachel: Yes It Is! I Saw You Guys Going At It Behind The Card Catalog! (Ross is at a loss for words.)
Will: Mrs. Altman? She Also Made Out With Takaka Ci-Kek The Night Before He Went back to Thailand.
Chandler: Im Sorry. When You Were In High School You Made Out With A 50-year-old woman?
Ross: Hey! She didnt look 50!
Chandler: Did she look 16?
Rachel: Ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Phoebe: Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
Ross: She didnt photograph well!
Chandler: Well, She Probably Wasnt Familiar With The Process Having Spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Phoebe: So How Did This Happen? Did She, Did She Lure You To An Early Bird dinner?
Ross: I Was Working Late In The Library One Afternoon. It Was Just The Two Of Us. She Needed Some Help With Her Word Jumble. And One Thing Led To Another. If You Must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace

Will: Yeah! (They high-five.)
Phoebe: I wanna join!
Rachel: WhPhoebe!!
Phoebe: Im Sorry. Im Sorry. I Never Got To Be In A Club. I-I Didnt Go To High School, But Three Of Us Would Meet Behind A Dumpster To Learn French. Bonjour.
Rachel: All Right, Yknowfine! You Guys Have Your Stupid Little Club, But I Would Just Like To Say Is What You Did To Me Is Way Worse Than What I Did To You! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)
Monica: All Right, Listen Youre Just Being Silly. Rachel, Even With That Rumor You Were One Of The Most Popular Girls In School And Everyone Wanted To Be Like You. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Rachel: Wow
Monica: And Ross, If It Werent For Rachels Rumor I Mean No One In high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Ross: As a romancer of the elderly.
Monica: Hey! Mrs. Altman Was The Kind Of Woman You Could Tell She Used To Be pretty.
Ross: The eyesdid still sparkle.
Monica: Hey Guys This Stuff Is Just So Way In The Past. You-Youve Been Through So Much Since Then. And Right Now Youve Got So Much More Important Stuff going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?
Rachel: Shes right.
