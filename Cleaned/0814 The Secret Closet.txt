Joey: Then why do you throw like one?
Chandler: Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.

Chandler: So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Joey: Uh, Really Good. Really Good. Yeah, I Should Be Ready To Kill Myself Any Day Now. (Chandler Returns With A Bobby Pin And Hands It To Joey.) Wow, You Sure Found That Quick. (He Tries The Pin In The Lock.) I Justi Wish I Didnt Feel This Way About Rachel Anymore, Yknow? I Wish Things Could Go Back To Normal. I Mean, I Love Living With Her And God, Helping Out With The Baby Is Just Amazing, But Now I Thinki Think Ross Feels Left Out. Yknow? When I Had To Take Rachel To The Hospital, The Doctor Thought I Was The Father. God You Shouldve Seen The Look On Rosss Face. (Pause) By The Way, I Have No Idea What Im Doing Here. For All I Know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
Chandler: Thats a good idea.
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: Okay. (They Switch Places And Chandler Gets Out A Credit Card.) So Uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Joey: Oh, I justI feel terrible.
Chandler: Well, Its Not Your Fault. What Are You Gonna Do? Not Take Her To The Hospital? Yknow? Youre Doing Nothing Wrong. (Pause) Except For Harboring An All Consuming Love For The Woman Whose Carrying His Baby. (He Loses His Card Behind The Door.) Richard? If-If Youre In There, Could You Pass Me My Credit Card?

Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: I mean $500.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: 600.
Monica: Whats going on?
Phoebe: Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Monica: What? (Laughs.)
Phoebe: Yeah, And It Really Freaked Me Out! And After A While I Even Tried To hurt you and it just spurred you on.
Monica: What?! Youre Crazy! Theres Nothing Sexual About The Noises I make!
Phoebe: Really? Theres Nothing Sexual About This? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some Cute Guy Is Watching Closely.) (To Him) What Are You Looking At?! (Pause) I mean hi.
