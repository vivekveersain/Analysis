Monica: Okay, Well, We Have To Get Past This! Why Dont We Get Rid Of The Tape and pretend it never existed?

Chandler: I can do that.

Monica: Okay. (Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion)

Chandler: Okay. Now All Weve Got To Do Is Get Rid Of This Chair. (Chandler Crawls Over To Monica And They Move In To Kiss, But They Cant Do It And Back Up. They Move In To Kiss Again, And Kiss Very Awkwardly For A Second, Until Someone knocks on the door.)

Monica: Oh, thank God!

Chandler: Oh, I know!

Monica: Come in!

Rachel: (Entering) Hi! Im So Sorry To Barge In On Your Valentines, But I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.

Monica: Oh, my God.

Chandler: Poor Ross. (Monica And Chandler Both Look At Each Other And Run Over To The Window To Watch The action in Ross apartment)

Chandler: Oh, Great. We Have To Watch Him Do Yoga In His Underwear, But For This He closes the drapes!

Monica: Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here.
