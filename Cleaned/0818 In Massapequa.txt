For That And So Many Other Things I Want To Say Thank You. I Know I Probably Dont Say It Enough, But I Love You. (Pretends To Cry Hoping Her Parents Will Join Her.) When I Look Around This Room, Im-Im Saddened By The Thought Of Those Who Could Not Be Here With Us. Nana, My Beloved Grandmother Who Would So Want To Be Here, But She Cant Because Shes Dead. As Is Our Dog Chi-Chi. I Mean Look How Cute She Is. (Holds Up The Picture And Pretends To Cry Again). Was. (To An Old Man By The Stage.) Do Me A Favor And Pass This To My Parents. Remember Shes Dead.

Phoebe: Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? 
Parker: I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words
Phoebe: Oh thank God. 
Parker: Its A Haven. A Third-Floor Paradise. A Modern-Day Eden In The midst
Phoebe: Yeah? I Know! I Know! Uh Huh? Listen Why Dont We Just Um, Sit And relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! 
Parker: That Sounds Great. (Sits Down) My God This Is The Most Comfortable Couch Ive ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)
Phoebe: Lets try something else, lets play a game.
Parker: I love games!
Phoebe: Shocking! Lets Play The Game Of Who Can Stay Quiet The Longest. (Giggles)
Parker: OrJenga.
Phoebe: But, Lets Play This One First. And Remember Whoever Talks First Loses!  (They sit back)
Parker: I lose, now Jenga.
Phoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! 
Parker: Is something wrong?
Phoebe: Wrong? Really? You Know The Word Wrong. Everything Isnt Perfect? Everything Isnt Magical? Everything Isnt A Glow With The Light Of A Million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! 
Parker: Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
Phoebe: You dont have to put a good spin on everything.
Parker: Im sorry thats who I am. Im a positive person.
Phoebe: No! I Am A Positive Person. You Are Like Santa Clause On Prozac, At Disneyland, getting laid! 
Parker: So What Do You Want Me To Do, You Want Me To Be More Negative, Less happy?
Phoebe: Much less happy!
Parker: Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "Id better be going." 
Phoebe: So Long! Dont Let The Best Door In The World Hit You In The Ass On Your Way Out! (He Exits And She Slams The Door Behind Him.) (Theres a knock on door, and Phoebe opens it.)
Parker: Isnt This The Most Incredible Fight Youve Ever Had In Your entire life? 
Phoebe: Uh Huh. (Closes Door) [Scene: Ross and Rachels, theyre returning from the party.]
Ross: And Then, We Couldve Gone From The Ceremony To The Reception with you in the sidecar!
Rachel: Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.
Ross: But Having A Dove Place The Ring On Your Finger Wouldve Been No problem?
Rachel: It was really fun being married to you tonight. 
Ross: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.
Rachel: Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: That proposal, at the planetarium
Ross: I know, I know it was stupid. 
Rachel: Are You Kidding?! With The, With The Lilies, And-And The Song, And The stars! It wasreally wonderful! Did you just make that up? 
Ross: No, Actually I Thought About It When, When We Were Going Out. Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. 
Rachel: Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. 
Ross: Its A Good Thing I Didnt Do It, Because It Sounds Like It wouldve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night
Rachel: Goodnight (They go off to their bedrooms)
Ross: Even If The Sidecar Had A Windscreen So Your Hair Wouldnt Get Messed up? 
Rachel: I will think about it. 
Ross: Thats All Im Askin  Ending Credits [Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Monica are there.]
Monica: Okay Thats It. I Give Up. At Mom And Dads 40Th anniversary, youre the one giving the speech. 
Ross: Yknow I Dont Understand Why They Didnt Cry. It Was A beautiful speech. 
Monica: Oh, come on. 
Ross: Hey! All That Stuff You Said About True Love, You Were Right, I Mean, We Did Learn A Lot From Mom And Dad! And That Picture Of Chi-Chi With Her Mischievous Grin. And What You Said About Nana. Ohh, Yeah She Really Wouldve Wanted To Be There. And you know what? I think she was.
