And Even Though I Am So Looking Forward To The Next Part, I Am Really Gonna Miss Being Pregnant. [Scene: Central Perk, time lapse, and Rachel is entering still pregnant.]
Rachel: Thats Right, Still No Baby! (To Monica, Joey, And Chandler On The couch) Come on people! Please make some room!
Ross: Uh Sweetie, Maybe Youd Be More Comfortable Here? (Gets Up From The green armchair.)
Rachel: You. Like you havent done enough.
Ross: Look, I-I Know How Miserable You Are, I Wish There Was Something I Can Do. I Mean I Wish I Were A Seahorse. (She Glares At Him) Because With Seahorses Its The Male, They Carry The Babies. And Then Also Umm, Id Be Far Away In The Sea. (He Sits Back Down.) (Rachel Turns And Looks At The Group On The Couch And They Move Over. Chandler Measures The Room Theyve Made With His Arm And Decides Its Not Enough And They All Move over again.)
Rachel: God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Phoebe: Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
Rachel: (Interrupting Her) Oh Phoebe, Thats A Great Story. Can You Tell It To Me When Youre Getting Me Some Iced Tea? (Phoebe Gets Up And Rachel Groans.) (To the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
Chandler: Lets. (Everyone Gets Up And Leaves Rachel.) Opening Credits [Scene: Monica And Chandler'S, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey, And Monica Are There As Rachel enters.]
Chandler: Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Rachel: Do You Want Me To Come Over There And Sit On You? Cause Ill do it.
Monica: What are you doing here so early?
Rachel: They Sent Me Home From Work. They Were Like, "Start Your Maternity Leave Now! Just Rest, Get Ready For The Baby." Well Yknow What? Screw Em! If they dont want me there, Ill just hang out with you guys.
Phoebe: Or You Can Do Volunteer Work. (Joeys cell phone rings and he answers it.)
Joey: Hello?
Estelle: Joey! Its Estelle! Great News, I Was Able To Get You And One guest tickets to your premiere.
Joey: One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Estelle: Well, I Sold Four Of Them On Ebay. Youll Be Sitting Next to HotGuy372.
Joey: Oh my God. So thats it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Estelle: Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?
Joey: (To Monica, Chandler, And Phoebe) Did You Hear That? I Only Get One Extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Rachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?
Joey: You said you didnt want to go.
Rachel: I Dont. But I Would Still Like To Be Acknowledged. What? Just because Im pregnant you think Im invisible.
Joey: Definitely not invisible.
Monica: Well, Well Ross Didnt Care Enough To Be Here, So I Think Hes out. You snooze you lose.
Chandler: Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.
Monica: Well Then Somebodys Snoozing. Joey, Not That This Uh Should Affect You At All, But If You Were To Pick Me, I Was Planning On Wearing A Sequined Dress, Cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)
Chandler: I havent seen this dress.
Monica: Star in a movie.
Phoebe: Joey, You Pick Who Ever You Want. Okay? You Just Listen To Your Heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.
Joey: Well uhI think I want to take Chandler.
Phoebe: (Still Mimicking A Heartbeat, Only Faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebeburrrrr! (Mimics The Sound Of A Cardiac Monitor Going off.)
Chandler: You really want to take me?
Joey: Yeah! Yeah! I Mean Im Sorry, I Wish I Can Take Everybody, But Yknow Chandler Always Supported My Career. Hes Paid For Acting Classes And head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
Chandler: So youre never actually going to pay me back?
Monica: Wait A Minute, Just Because He Paid For Your Head Shots Youre Gonna Take Him? Joey, I Dont Think Youre Comprehending Just How Slutty This dress is!
Joey: Its Not Just The Stuff He Paid For, I Mean Its-Its Everything. Yknow? He Read Lines With Me. He-He Went With Me On Auditions When I Was Really Nervous, And Then He Consoled Me After I Didnt Get Parts That I Really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself.
Chandler: I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.
Joey: Thanks. That Means A Lot To Me. (They look at each other and smile for a while.)
Phoebe: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
Joey: (in a manly voice) Im gonna go shave. (Gets up.)
Chandler: (In A Manly Voice) Yeah Well, Im Gonna Go Spit. (He Goes Into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
Rachel: Oh, I Have To Pee. If I Dont Come Out In Five Minutes Its because Ive choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)
Phoebe: When She Comes Out, You Hold Her Nose, Ill Blow In Her Mouth, And the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
Monica: Shes over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
Phoebe: I dont know. I-I think its still gonna be a while.
Monica: Hmm, Care To Make It Interesting? Ill Bet You That Shell have it by this time tomorrow.
Phoebe: Youre on!
Monica: Okay, how much?
Phoebe: One hundred thousand dollars!
Monica: How about fifty bucks?
Phoebe: Fine! Ill call Zurich and move some money around.
Rachel: (Calling From The Bathroom) All Right, Whos Turn Is It To Help Me Get Up! (They both look at each other, then Phoebe gets an idea.)
Phoebe: No Ones Here! (Monica Looks At Her.) Oh Damnit! [Scene: The World Premiere Of Over There, Joey And Chandler Are Arriving In A Limo And are about to walk down the red carpet.]
Chandler: This Is So Exciting! Its So Glamorous! People Taking Our picture. How do I look?

Joey: Do You Mind Crouching Down A Little Bit, So That I Look Taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)
Chandler: Its Just So Glamorous. [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is entering, still pregnant.]
Phoebe: Oh Hey Mon? Rach Is Here! Ohh, Youre Still Pregnant. Oh, Im Sorry. I Know How Uncomfortable You Are. Yknow What? You Look Great. Yeah, Like fifty bucks.
Rachel: Oh, I Have To Go Pee. Apparently This Baby Thinks That My Bladder Is A squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
Monica: Damnit! Damnit!! Heres your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)

Ross: Uh, Do You Wanna Go Change First? The Doctors Keeping The Office open late for us, but if you hurry
Rachel: No, Im fine.
Ross: Really? You Dont Think Thats A Little Inappropriate. (Shes wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
Phoebe: Good God man dont anger it.
Rachel: Ross, It Is 100 Degrees Outside. For The First Time In Weeks, I Am somewhat comfortable.
Ross: Fine! Fine! Yknow What? Whatever You Want. Okay? Youre The mommy.
Rachel: Oh Uh-Uh Pal! Dont Call Me Mommy! Its Bad Enough You Call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
Monica: Im Actually With Her On This One. [Scene: Inside Joeys Premiere, he is intently watching the movie.]
Joey: (Onscreen) "I Thought I Knew Who The Enemy Was, But It Was You All along." 
Joey: (To Chandler) Okay, This Is It. Its My Big Fight Scene Coming Up. (He Looks Over And Chandler And Notices That Hes Asleep.) [Scene: Dr. Longs Office, Ross And Rachel Are Waiting For The Doctor. Ross Is drumming his fingers on the bed.]

Ross: Wow!
Rachel: Excuse me?!
Ross: Oh Nothing. Nothing! Just Uh, Youve Been A Little Short With Me lately. Im not trying to irritate you.
Rachel: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Ross: Yknow What? The Doctor Will Be In Soon, Why Dont We Not Speak until then.

Dr. Long: So, eight days late huh?
Rachel: Yeah.
Dr. Long: You must be a little uncomfortable.
Rachel: Eh, just a tad.
Dr. Long: Youre About 80 Percent Effaced, So Youre On Your Way. It Still Could Last A Little While Longer. If Youre Anxious There Are A Few Ways To help things along.
Ross: Do them!!
Dr. Long: Actually, Theyre Things You Can Do. Just Some Home Remedies, But in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective.
Rachel: Well, we are ready to try anything.
Dr. Long: Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.
Rachel: Okay.
Dr. Long: You can take some caster oil, theres eating spicy foods
Rachel: Great! We will do all of those.
Dr. Long: Taking A Long Walk, And Then Theres The One Thats Proved Most Effective: Sex. (Rachel turns and looks at Ross.)

Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Ross: Yeah, We Tried Them All. We Went For A Walk, Uh We Tried A Special Tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Rachel: Well, There Is One Thing That We Havent Tried, But Someone Thinks that, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms."

Ross: Its sex.
Monica: Do it!

Monica: Im Just Saying Its Been A Really Long Time For You. I Mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
Phoebe: Oh I-I Dont Know About That. No, I Think That If The Two Of You had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
