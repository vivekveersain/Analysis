Joey: (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
Chandler: Sure.
Joey: Dude I just did something terrible.
Chandler: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Joey: No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Chandler: What?! Why does she think that?
Joey: Because it kinda looked like I did.
Chandler: Again, what?!
Joey: Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
Chandler: As we all are at some point during the day.
Joey: It Wasnt My Ring! It Fell Out Of Rosss Jacket! And When I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
Chandler: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Joey: I guess.
Chandler: And You Did It First?! This Is Gonna Kill Him! You Know How Much He loves to propose!
Joey: I know! I know its awful.
Chandler: Well, what did she say?
Joey: (happily) She said yes.
Chandler: Does Ross know?
Joey: Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
Chandler: Well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.
Joey: Oh, I like that. Yeah
Chandler: If You Clear Things Up With Rachel Then Ross Never Needs To Find Out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Joey: (Laughs) Now Lets Not Get Carried Away. (He Walks Away As Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)
Monica: I want a baby.
Chandler: Honey, weve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Monica: Come On! Come On, If We Have Sex Again Itll Double Our Chances Of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?
Chandler: Im So Tired. (She Starts Kissing Him.) Yeah Okay, But No foreplay.
Monica: Deal! [Back in front of the nursery window.]
Ross: Dad seriously! Yknow you really should see someone about that!
Mr. Geller: Noted.
Ross: I Wanna Go Talk To Rachel For A Minute, Are You Gonna Be Okay Alone For A bit?

Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hi.

Rachel: Uhh I think I just got engaged.
Phoebe: Oh my God! He did it?
Rachel: Welldid you know he was gonna ask me?
Phoebe: Are You Kidding? Im Like The One Who Talked Him Into It. I Like To think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?
Phoebe: I Just Talked Him Into It, Dont Tell Me I Have To Do You Too. The puppet master gets tired people.
Rachel: I just dont know! It just doesnt feel right.
Phoebe: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Rachel: Really?! Even Ross?
Phoebe: Especially Ross!

Joey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!
Rachel: Its just so frustrating! Why doesnt she want my breast?!
Joey: I Dont Know! Maybe Shes Crazy! (Storms Out.) [Scene: The Lobby, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.]
Phoebe: Oh hey! Wait up!
Ross: Hi!
Phoebe: Congratulations! I Didnt Want To Say Anything In Front Of Joey cause I didnt know if he knew yet.
Ross: What, That We Had A Baby? Come On Lets Give Him A Little Credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
Phoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
Ross: What?
Phoebe: Oh, Its A Secret. Oh Goodie! Yes! We Havent Done The Secret thing in a long time.
Ross: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnt propose.
Phoebe: Are You Lying? Is This Like That Time You Tried To Convince Us That You were a doctor?
Ross: (Pause) I Am A Doctor! Yknow What? Im Just Gonna Go And talk to Rachel myself.
Phoebe: All Right, Me Too. (They Go Into Her Room And See That Shes sleeping.) Should we wake her up?
Ross: No! No, come on let her sleep! Shes so exhausted.
Phoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
Ross: What? (Motions For Phoebe To Go Outside With Him.) Oh My God! She-She thinks were engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think were engaged?!
Phoebe: Perhaps Because You Gave Her An Engagement Ring? Yknow Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
Ross: I didnt give her that ring!
Phoebe: Really?
Ross: No!
Phoebe: So whose ring is it?
Ross: Its mine.
Phoebe: Is it an engagement ring?
Ross: Yes!
Phoebe: But you didnt give it to her?
Ross: No!
Phoebe: But you were going to propose?
Ross: No!!
Phoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Ross: Look. Look, My Mom Gave Me That Ring Because She Wanted Me To Propose To Rachel, But All I Wanted To Do Is If She Maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again.
Phoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Ross: Look, I Didnt Want To Rush Into Anything. And It Seemed Like She Didnt Want To Either. But I Dont, I Dont Understand How Any Of This Happened! What? Did She Find The Ring In My Jacket, Assume That I Was Going To Propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Phoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Ross: Well I Didnt! I Didnt Propose! (Pause) Unless Uh (Pause) Did I? I Havent Slept In Forty Hours Andit Does Sound Like Something I Would Do. Commercial Break [Scene: The Janitors Closet, Chandler And Monica Are Trying To Figure Out What To do now.]
Chandler: Look, we cant stay in here forever.
Monica: Oh, I Still Cant Believe My Dad Saw Us Having Sex! He Didnt make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Chandler: This Is Okay. Were All Adults Here; Theres Nothing To Be Ashamed Of. Now, Lets Put Our Underwear In Our Pockets And Walk Out The Door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Mr. Geller: Of course. Ill always be your dad.
Chandler: I Just Want You To Know That What You Witnessed In There, That wasnt for fun.
Monica: It wasnt fun?!
Chandler: (To Monica) Why? Why-Why-Would Youwh-Why (To Mr. Geller) Look, I Just Dont Want You To Think That Were Animals Who Do It Whenever We want.
Mr. Geller: Oh, I Dont Think That. Before Today I Never Thought Of You Two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
Monica: The truth is, Dad, were-were trying.
Mr. Geller: What?
Monica: Yeah, were trying to get pregnant.
Mr. Geller: Oh My God! This Is So Exciting! Well, Get Back In There! (Points To the closet) Ill guard the door!

Monica: Daddy?!
Mr. Geller: Well You Gotta Get At It Princess! When Your Mother And I Were Trying To Conceive You, Whenever She Was Ovulating, Bam, We Did It. Thats How I Got my bad hip.
Chandler: Thats Funny, This Conversations How I Got The Bullet Hole in my head.
Mr. Geller: This One Time I Had My Knee Up On The Sink And Your Mother, She was
Monica: Daddy! I Dont Think We Need To Hear About The Specific Positions you and mom had sex.
Mr. Geller: Youre Right, Youre Right. This Is About Your Positions. Now, What I Saw In The Closet Is Not The Optimum Position For Conceiving A Child, Although it might feel good.
Monica: I dont feel good right now.
Mr. Geller: But Pleasure Is Important, (To Chandler) And It Helps If The Woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
Chandler: Seriously Sir, My Brains? All Over The Wall. [Scene: Rachels Room, Monica is entering.]
Monica: Hey.
