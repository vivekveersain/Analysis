I Was Like, If I Fall Asleep Now Ill Get Six Hours Sleep, But If I Fall Asleep Now Ill Get Five Hours Sleep. Not Matter What I did I couldnt fall asleep.

Ms. Mckenna: The Numbers We Are Seeing New York, Chicago, And London Are Consistently Solid, But Many Of Our Officers Have Reported Disappointing Fields. (Chandler drifts off and his arm slips off the table and he wakes back up.)
Ms. Mckenna: Boston Is Down, Atlanta Is Down, Houston Is Down, I Could Go On And On But Instead Of Boring You Ill Go Straight To My Forty Two Point Plan. (Chandler Leans Over To Fall Asleep On The Mans Shoulder Next To Him, Only The man catches his attempt.)
Chandler: Walter (Nods). [Scene: Ross And Rachels, Phoebe, Monica, Ross, And Rachel Are Watching Emma sleep.]
Phoebe: Shes Just So Cute! I Just Wanna Bite Her Ear Off And Use It And A sucking candy.
Monica: Phoebe! But I Could Take One Of Those Little Feet And Put It In A Pita pocket.

Joey: I said I didnt technically.
Ross: Okay Lets Put Aside That You (Makes Quote Marks With His Fingers.) "Accidentally" Picked Up My Grandmothers Ring And You (Does It Again) "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Joey: Look, Can I Just Stop You Right There For A Second? When People Do This (Makes Quote Marks With His Fingers.) I Dont Really Know What That Means. (Ross Just looks at him) You were saying?
Ross: And I Can Even Understand That You Couldnt Tell Rachel, But Why couldnt you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didnt.
Joey: I Know I Shouldve. (Makes Quote Marks Again.) "Im sorry." 
Ross: Not Using It Right, Joe. (He brings his hands in closer to his face then does it again.)
Ross: Im gonna go.
Joey: No, Come On Ross! (He Grabs His Bag So He Cant Leave) Look, Ross, We have to get past this.
Ross: Give me the bag.
Joey: No, look, I dont know what else to do. I said Im sorry!
Ross: Joey!
Joey: You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
