Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Yeah! Yeah! Ok! Sure! Look! Can We...Can We Talk About What  happened here last night?
Chandler: Sure! Just Give Me A Second To Get All Huffy And Weird Like  You! Do You Believe That Who Everdid Something Over Here Last Night Did What  they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Ross: OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Chandler: No!
Ross: Ok! Last Night After The Party I Saw Rachel Kissing That Jerk From  her office out on your balcony.
Chandler: Our Balcony? Seriously? That'S So Funny Because I Told Monica  We Should Put Lights On Our Balcony. And She Said"No, No. It'S Too Cold,  Nobody Will Go Out There." And I Said "Maybe If We Put Some Light Out There They  will"
Ross: Right That'S Why I Came Over To Talk About. Hum...I Saw Rachel  kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
Chandler: So are you gonna...talk to her?
Ross: Why...Why Should I? I Mean If She Wants To Move On, That'S  fine!
Chandler: You Know When "That'S Fine" Sounds True When Someone Yells It  and spits!
Ross: No I'M Serious. I Mean She Wants To Date People? Fine! I Don'T Care  But...At Least She Could Have Told Me. You Knowi...I'Ve Been Putting My Life  On Hold And Just Concentrating On Emma But If She Wants To Go Out There Kissing  Guys Shebarely Knows, Then So Will I ! Very Funny! Ross Is Gay! Ah!  Ah!
Chandler: No No No. Good. So You'Re Moving On? Do You Have Any Idea Where  you're moving?
Ross: I Don'T Know. I Mean I Have Plenty Of Opportunity. Just Just Now  There Were Some Women At The Coffee House Smiled At Me.And Then The Other  day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Chandler: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Ross: Well, And How About This? There Is An Anthropologist At School Who  totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
Chandler: Why did I get married?!

 [Opening Credits]
 [Scene: Central Perk]
Joey: Hey! Let Me Ask You Guys Something. I Have A New Headshot Taken  Tomorrow Right And The Photographer Said She Thinks Ishould Have My Eyebrows  waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Phoebe: Well it depends.
Joey: On...?
Phoebe: On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Monica: No I Totally Disagree. No I Think It'S Fine For A Guy To Do  Something Like That. Such You An Actor. Not That You Need To,Your Eyebrows  are...
Joey: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Phoebe: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Joey: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Phoebe: Wow! Talking about high maintenance
Joey: Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Phoebe: I'm a woman!
Joey: Arghhh! Double standards!
Phoebe: Oh Before I Forget, Are You Coming To Mike'S Piano Bar  tonight?
Monica: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Phoebe: But Everybody Sings. It'S So Much Fun! Last Time This Adorable  Old Man Got Out There, Forgot All Of The Words, Flipped Outand Everyone  booed him off the stage. So funny.
Monica: It's just, I'm not good at singing.
Phoebe: Oh! What'S The Matter? Are You Scared? You'Re Afraid I'M A Better  singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Monica: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Phoebe: Ok Fine! Please Come And Support Mike. You Don'T Have To  sing.
Monica: So I Don'T Have To Sing And I Can Just Sit There And Pass  judgments on others?
Phoebe: While drinking...
Monica: I'm there!
Rachel: Hi Guys! Listen I Really Need Your Help. I Think I Did Something  really stupid.
Phoebe: Well Yes Rachel But You Got Something So Beautiful Out  there
Rachel: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Phoebe: Oh my god.
Monica: You kissed him?
Rachel: Yeah. It Was After The Party, We Were On The Balcony  and...
Monica: Wait Wait Wait. I Was At Home The Whole Time. How Did I Missed  that?
Phoebe: It Was The End Of The Party, You Were Probably Ironing Wrapping  paper.
Monica: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Rachel: You Know We Were All Alone And He Was Being Really Nice To Me  and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Monica: I thought you hated him?
Rachel: You Know Honey, There Is A Thin Line Between Love And Hate, And  it turns out that line...is a scarf!
Monica: So Are You Thinking Of Starting Up Something With This  guy?
Rachel: I Don'T Know. It'S So Complicated. I Work With This Guy, You  Know, I Have The Baby, And I Have Ross, And I Just...I Don'Tknow What To Do  and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
Monica: Sounds Like You Need To Think About What You Want, Talk To Gavin,  and you definitely should talk to Ross
Rachel: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Phoebe: Wow! Five-Month Maternity Leave, You'Re Back For Four Days, Kiss  a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!

Rachel: Oh no no no
Gavin: So I had fun last night
Rachel: So did I
Gavin: Exactly How Contagious Is This Thing You Have? I Mean Is It A Cold  for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?

Rachel: What? What's the matter?
Gavin: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
Rachel: Oh He'S Dusting Me With A Fossil Brush. He Thought It Would Be  funny.

Gavin: So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Rachel: I thought it was Ross.
Gavin: So What If It Was? I Thought There Was Nothing Going On Between  you two...
