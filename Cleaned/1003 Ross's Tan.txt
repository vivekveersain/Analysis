Chandler: Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Joey: Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Chandler: What Must It Be Like Not To Be Crippled By Fear   and self-loathing.
Joey: (pause) It's OK!
Chandler: How can you be so confident?
Joey: Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Chandler: Really? Like you have a routine?
Joey: No, No No No No. See. Each Woman Is Different.You Have   to appreciate their uniqueness.
Chandler: Really?
Joey: No, I Do Six Things! First, I Look Deep In Her Eyes.   Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Chandler: You Mean Like This? (He Starts Touching His Thigh   in a funny and awkard way)
Joey: No! Not Like That, No No. No, Like This. (He Starts   lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)
Chandler: Oh, I See What You Mean, That'S Quite Nice. (They   look at each other, both embarassed)
Joey: More foosball?
Chandler: ...and beer!!

Chandler: Was that place... The Sun?
Ross: Oh! And It Gets Worse! (Turns His Side To Chandler   And Monica And Pulls Up His Shirt. There'S A Distinct Line Across His Body,   where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
Chandler: Oh My God! You Can Do A Duet Of Ebony And Ivory   all by yourself!
Monica: How Could You Mess This Up? It'S   so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!

Chandler: You didn't like that?
Rachel: Well, It Wasn'T Just Me, Alright? He Freaked Out   too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Monica: Wow, Really? One Time He Just Looked   At My Bra And It Popped Open. (Chandler starts looking at her bra)
Rachel: I Do Not Know What'S Wrong With Us, I Mean, We Have   Kissed Before And That'S Been Great! But This Time It Was Leading Somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Monica: Well, You Guys Have Been Friends   Forever. Remember The First Time That You Kissed Ross? How Weird That Was?   You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.

Monica: Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Is Amanda here yet?
Phoebe: No.
Monica: (Sits Down) Oh Good. Good, Look   I'M So Sorry, For Screwing Up That Cutting-Her-Out Plan. But I Have A New Plan.   Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Phoebe: Oh! Well, What Kind Of Emergency That Gets Us Both   out of here?
Monica: Well, What Do You Think Of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident?
Phoebe: (Makes A Face) Are You Kidding, I Love It! (A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda)
Phoebe: Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Amanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)
Amanda: (To Monica) Hello! (Monica Holds Her Hands Out For A Hug, But Instead Of Hugging Her, Amanda   hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.)
Amanda: (In A Fake British Accent) It'S So Nice To See You!   Both Of You! Look At Me. Look How Young I Look! (Gives Her Coat To Monica As   Well) Oh Gosh! We Have So Much To Catch Up On! But First Things First: Touch   My Abs (At Which Point She Grabs Both Phoebe And Monica'S Hands And Places   Them Both On Her Stomach) I Don'T Exercise At All! (She Pulls Them Down To   sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
Monica: (Beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His Name Is   Chandler and...
Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell My Neck! (Phoebe Does So) It'S   Not Perfume! It'S Me! It'S My Natural Scent! (Monica looks shocked)
Phoebe: Musty!
Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This Is Brilliant. Gosh, It'S Just Like   old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
Monica: When were we not friends?
Amanda: Well, It Was 1992, And I Remember Because That Was   the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).
Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Amanda: (To Phoebe) No I Distinctly Remember You Were Dodging   her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her. 
Monica: (To Phoebe) You Were Going To Cut   me out?
Phoebe: Well...kinda.
Monica: Oh My God!
Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I Not Have Said That? I Feel Like   a perfect arse!
Phoebe: Yeah Well, In America You'Re Just An "Ass". (Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.)
Monica: (Into The Phone) Hello? Chandler,   What'S Wrong? (She Listens) Oh My God, Are You Alright? (Listens Some More)   Yeah, I'Ll Be Right There. (She Hangs Up And Speaks To Amanda) I'M So Sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)
Phoebe: (Also Gets Up And Starts Taking Her Purse) Oh My   God. Was Mike with him?
Monica: Nope! (She Turns And Leaves) [Scene: Joey And Rachel'S Apartment.] (Joey comes running in.)
Joey: (To Rachel) Hey!
Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?
Joey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Rachel: Excellent! Stick It In The Ice Bucket, The Phone   Is Off The Hook, And In The Interest Of Powering Through (Starts To Remove   her bra from under her clothes)...
Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him) 
Rachel: Ok (Starts To Light Some Candles) Sexy, Sexy, Very   Sexy, Sexy. (Claps Her Hands And Jumps At Joey, Clearly Very Excited) Alright!   Lets do it!
Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Rachel: Oh! Get Over It Soldier, We'Ve Gotta Do This! (She   Pulls Him Towards Her And Throws Him Onto The Barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You Like   that huh?
Joey: Oh! yeah!
Rachel: You Like That? (She Climbs On The Barcalounger Seductively,   Putting Her Knees Next To Joey'S Hips.) Let'S Take This Into High Gear (She   Pulls The Barcalounger Lever And Seat Reclines. She Puts One Of Her Knees Between   his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
Joey: uh uh!
Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Joey: (He Just Sits There, Legs Very Close Together With   A Painful Look On His Face) Soldier Down! [Monica And Chandlers Apartment.] (Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.)
Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Chandler: If She Asks, I Protested A Little, But Ok! (Phoebe and Amanda walk in)
Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God You'Re Alive. Monica, Can   I talk to you outside for a minute?
Monica: I Have Nothing To Say To   you.
Amanda: (Announces More To Herself Than Anyone Else) Wow,   my flat is twice this size!
Phoebe: Please, Monica? In The Hall? (They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.)
Amanda: Ooh, That Accident Must Have Been Terrible. You Look   positively ghastly.
Chandler: Well, Aren'T You A Treat. [Scene: The hallway]
Monica: I Can'T Believe You Tried To Cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Phoebe: It Was Right After We Were Living Together And You   Were Driving Me Crazy, Okay? You Were Really Controlling And Compulsive And   shrill.
Monica: I'm still all those things!
Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.
Phoebe: Exactly! Look, No Matter What I Tried To Do, I Couldn'T   Keep You Out Of My Life. Of All The People I Have Cut Out, You Were The Only   one who ever clawed her way back in.
Monica: It's because I'm scrappy.
Phoebe: Yeah, You Are. And I'M So Glad That You Fought Your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica: I Won'T Know What I Would Do Without   You. (They hug)
Monica: Well, I Guess We Should Go Back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe: Yeah, I Guess You'Re Right. (They Both Enter The Apartment Again, Where Amanda Is "Dancing" For   Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)
Amanda: Can You Believe It. I'Ve Never Had Any Professional   Dance Training. (Monica And Phoebe Look At Each Other And Leave The Apartment Again) [Scene: A Different Spray-On Tan Center] (Glenda, Who Works Here, And Ross Are Walking To The Room With The Spray-On Tan booth.)
Glenda: Now, Let Me Explain How This Works. You Go Into The   booth, and...
Ross: I'M Gonna Stop You Right There, Glenda. Okay? Does   It Look Like This Is My First Time, Huh? Now I Want 4 Two'S... And I Want Them   all on my back.
Glenda: (Quietly) Okay... (Ross Enters The Room, Takes Off His Robe And Enters The Booth. He Stands   With His Back To The Nozzles And Then Realises That This Booth Has Nozzles   at both sides of the wall)
Ross: Wait A Minute, There'S Two Sets Of Nozzles, Which One   Is It? (He turns around frantically from side to side.)
Ross: Which... Which... Which... Which One Is It? (He Then Stops Turning, Facing One Of The Nozzles, Which Starts Spraying In   this face and front again.)
Ross: Oh! Son Of A Bitch! (He Now Turns To The Other Side, Which Also Starts Spraying His Face And Front.) [Scene: Joey And Rachel'S] (Joey And Rachel Are Both Sitting On The Couch. Joey Keeping His Knees Pressed against each other)
Rachel: What is the matter with us?
Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Rachel: No, I Mean With Us, You Know. I Mean, Is It Supposed   to be this... difficult?
Joey: I Don'T Know. (Chandler enters the apartment)
Chandler: That Fake British Woman Is A Real Bitch, But She   sure can dance... Hey!
Rachel: Hi! Hey, Listen, Can We Ask You A Question? When   You And Monica First Hooked Up, Was It Weird Going From Friends To... More   than that?
Chandler: Kinda... You Know, Sneaking Around, Having To Hide   from you guys...
Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Joey: Yeah, Was There A Part Of You That... Felt Like It   was... really wrong?
Chandler: Actually, No. No, It Felt Right. You Know, It Felt   Like Uhm... I Can'T Believe We Haven'T Been Doing This The Whole Time. (Rachel And Joey Are Still Looking At Chandler, Slowly Letting His Words Get   to them)
Chandler: I Can Tell From Your Expressions That That'S The   Good News You Were Hoping For... Well, I'M Gonna Go Continue To... Spread The   joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
Rachel: Well, Just Because It Happened That Way For Them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Joey: Yeah, Yeah... Absolutely. I Mean, Just Because Something'S   difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Rachel: Right, totally.
Joey: Yeah, So We Just Keep Trying And Trying Until We...   do it.
Rachel: Yeah, And If Doesn'T Work, Then We'Ll Be Just One   of those couples that never have sex.
Joey: That'S A... Pla-An. (They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)
Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.
Rachel: I know.

Joey: I Don'T Get It. I Mean, I Was So Sure This Was What   I wanted. 
Rachel: Hmmm... Me Too... (She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)
Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Joey: I Guess They Weren'T As Good Friends As We Are. (Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)
Rachel: Aah... I Bet You'Re Right. (They look at each other for a while)
Joey: So...
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: I love ya.
Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Joey: Yeah, Me Too. (Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)
Joey: Ooh, Yeah, I'M Not Going Anywhere For A While. (Joey Takes The Ice-Bucket With The Champagne Bottle In It And Puts It On   his sore spot)

Chandler: Dude, It'S Chandler. Let Me In. (Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.)
Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Chandler: I Know, I Went To The Tanning Place And The Same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Ross: Really? Did You Count Mississipily? (Ross walks to the door and opens it.)
Ross: Dude, you're not tanned.
Chandler: No, I Just Had To Get A Picture Of This. (Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.)
Chandler: I See You Later! (Ross Closes The Door)  end
