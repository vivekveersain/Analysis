Jennifer: Previously on Friends...
Chandler: How did the job stuff go?
Rachel: He offered me one.
Ross: (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Rachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)
 FADE OUT
Rachel: Oh, God! Please, somebody  say something.
Ross: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Chandler: Or facing a bitch of a commute.
Rachel: I Know, It'S Huge, And It'S Scary, And It'S... Really Far, Far Away    From You Guys, But This Is Such An Incredible Opportunity For Me. And I'Ve Already    Talked To Them About Our Situation With Emma, And They Said They'Ll Do Whatever    we need to make us feel comfortable.
Ross: Okay.
Rachel: I Mean, I'Ll Fly Back And Forth, They'Ll Fly You Out...    Anything we want.
Chandler: My Boss Said I Might Be Getting A New Lamp In My Cubicle. (Monica    looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
Ross: All right, we'll work it out.
Rachel: Thank you! Thank you!
Ross: Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
Rachel: I Think It Is. (Ross Looks Very Sad. Phoebe    and Joey enter.)
Phoebe: Ooh, what's going on?
Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer.
Joey: Hey, great! All right!
Phoebe: Good for you!
Rachel: It's in Paris.
Joey: What? No, No, No! No, No... No... No, No... No, Too Much Is Changing,    Okay? First, Phoebe Getting Married (To Phoebe) Congratulations! (Pointing To    Monica And Chandler)... And Then These Two Move Into A Stupid House In The Stupid    suburbs...
Monica: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Joey: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Rachel: Look, You Guys... This Is Really, Really Important To Me. And It Means    a lot if you could try to get on board.
Phoebe: Of Course We Can. Congratulations. (They Hug, But Joey Shakes His Head.)    Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...
Joey: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Rachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...
Joey: Hey! No! Get Your France-Going-Arms Away From Me. (He Walks Out, And    Rachel follows him)
Rachel: Joey...
Phoebe: You okay with this?
Chandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Phoebe: Talking to Ross.
Chandler: I see.
Ross: Well, Rachel Moving To Another Country? Not Being Able To See Her Every    day. How can I be okay with this?
Monica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Ross: Do You Think If The Ralph Lauren People Offered Her Her Old Job Back,    she would take it?
Monica: How is that gonna happen?
Chandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Ross: I Don'T Know. I Could Talk To Her Boss. Yeah! I Met Him At That Christmas    party. We really hit it off.
Monica: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Ross: I didn't say we were brothers.
   OPENING CREDITS
 [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe'S Reading A Newspaper. Chandler    and Monica walk in.]
Monica: Hey Phoebe. Hey, Tell Me What You Think. All Right. The House Next    Door To The One That We'Re Buying In Westchester? Just Went On The Market. I Wanna    take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
Chandler: We Close Escrow Tomorrow, So Seeing Another House Can Only Confuse    us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Monica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Chandler: What do you think Pheebs?
Phoebe: Well, I Think That Shirt Makes You Look Like You Should Work At A Baskin    Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Chandler: Yeah.
Phoebe: She died.
Chandler: You're kidding!
Monica: That's terrible!
Phoebe: Yeah, Last Saturday. Wow! She Was The First Black Man To Fly Solo Across    The Atlantic. (Chandler And Monica Look Puzzled) Oh, Wait A Minute, I Read The    wrong one.
Chandler: Oh yeah? 
Phoebe: Yeah, she was just an agent.
Monica: Joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
Chandler: I Know. *He* Always Wanted To Be The First Black Man To Cross The    Atlantic.
Phoebe: Well, We Cannot Tell Joey About This. He'S Already Flipping Out About    everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Monica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Phoebe: Well, Not For A Little While. Let'S Just Give Him A Few Days To Get    used to everything else.
Monica: What if he reads it in the paper?
Chandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
 [Scene: Ralph Lauren. Mr Zelner'S Office. Ross Knocks On The    door and enters.]
Mr Zelner: May I help you?
Ross: Yeah, I'M A Friend Of Rachel Green'S. Uhm, Actually We Met At The Christmas    party about two years ago.
Mr Zelner: Oh right, uhm, Don?
Ross: Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
Mr Zelner: Uh... What can I do for you?
Ross: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Mr Zelner: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
Ross: Oh, No. At First I Have To Get You To Agree. Then We'Ll    see if she wants to come back.
Mr Zelner: Wow, that is tempting. 
Ross: Look, She Loved Her Job Here. And Let'S Face    It: You'Re Not Gonna Find Anyone Who Did It As Well As She Did It. Isn'T That    true?
Mr Zelner: She is good!
Ross: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.
Mr Zelner: But I'M Sorry. There'S Nothing I Can Do... Ah,    it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
Ross: I See... Thanks Very Much. (He Gets Up And Walks To The Door. On His    Way Out He Looks At The Photographs Mr Zelner Has Near His Door. He Picks One    up.) Is this your son?

Mr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?
Ross: Oh, Nothing, Its Just, Its Close To Ron. Does He.. Does    little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? 
Mr Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
Ross: How Would He Like To Come With Me To The Museum Of Natural History After    Everyone Else Has Left, Just The Two Of Us, And He Can Touch Anything He Wants.    (Mr. Zellner Looks Shocked). I Just Heard It As You Must Have Heard It And Thats    Not Good. Let Me Start Again. Im A Paleontologist, Youll Be There    with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils!
Mr Zelner: You can really arrange that?
Ross: You let Rachel come back, and its done. 
Mr Zelner: Well, I Guess Having Rachel Back Wouldnt Be The Worst Thing    in the world.
Ross: Yeah! Yes! Thank You! This Is Great. Thank You So Much. And I Swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Mr Zelner: Thats Great. I Worry About Little Ross. Hes Always    reading, he's collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs.
Ross: Hell be fine.
 [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebes Reading, Joey Has Just Entered    the room]
Joey: Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe: Hey. Everything ok?
Joey: Im just mad at my agent.
Phoebe: Estelle? Why?
Joey: Theres A Part In A Tv Movie That I Would Be Perfect For And I    didnt even be put up for it! Shed better have a good reason.
Phoebe: Im Guessing She Does.  Joey: Well (Taking His Cell Phone Out Of A Pocket) Im Wanna Hear It,    because she keeps doing this.
Phoebe: Well, No, No, Wait, Wait, Wait. All Right, I Gotta Go. Just Listen. Promise Me, That You    will wait a minute before you call her.
Joey: Ok. Why?
Phoebe: Because A Promise Between Friends Means Never Having To Give A Reason.    (she leaves)
Joey: I Love That Saying! (Phoebe Is Outside, Taking Her Cell Phone Out Of Her Bag And Making A Call.    Joey is inside, and his mobile phone starts ringing).
Joey: Hello?
Phoebe (doing Estelle): Joey, its Estelle.
Joey: I was just gonna call you! Thats weird.
Phoebe-Estelle: Its A Little Coincidental, But Believable.    (Joey Nods In Agreement). Listen, Im Sure Youre Wondering Why    I didnt get you an audition for that TV movie.
Joey: Yeah, actually I am!
Phoebe-Estelle: I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie! 

Joey: Thats it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Phoebe-Estelle: Dont Take That Tone With Me. Who You    think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Joey: No, No, Look. All Im Saying Is That Youre My Agent, Ok?    And youre not getting me into any auditions and Im tired of it.
Phoebe-Estelle: What are you saying?
Joey: Im Saying That (Pause). This Isn'T  Working For Me    anymore, ok? Estelle, youre fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).
Phoebe: Man, tough week for Estelle!

Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Hi.
Ross: Emma Left Her Stuffed T-Rex At My House. You Know She Cant Sleep    without it.
Rachel: Oh, well, shes asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Ross: Ok.
Rachel: Oh, Youre Not Gonna Believe What Happened To Me Today! Ralph    Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Ross: Nooo!
Rachel: Yee. I Mean, It Was So Weirdest Thing. They Fired Me And Then Out    Of Nowhere They Just Hire Me Back! I Mean, That Place Must Have Been Falling    apart without me.
Ross: So, youre not going to Paris.
Rachel: No, Im still going.
Ross: Wh whwhat?
Rachel: When The Louis Vuitton People Found Out That Ralph Lauren Wanted Me Back,    the offered me more money! Isnt that great?
Ross: Yeeeah! (They high-five) 
 [Scene: House Next To The One The Bings Are Moving Into. Chandler    and Monica knock, a lady opens the door.]
Monica: Hi. Were Buying The House Next Door, And We Were Wondering If We  could just take a look around.
Lady: Oh, Sure. Im Showing It To Someone Else Right Now,    but please, look around.
Monica: Thanks.
Chandler: It Feels Like Were Cheating On Our House.    And If Were Gonna Cheat, Shouldnt It Be With Like A Hot, Younger House,    that does stuff that our house wont do?
Monica: Ours Is So Much Better! This Living Room Is Smaller, The Dining Room Looks    like a cave! What a hole!
Lady: So? What do you think?
Monica: Love it!
Lady: Well, We Already Have One Offer On It, And I Think The Lady    upstairs is goning to make another one.
Monica: They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Lady: Oh, The Woman Upstairs Is Very Nice. She And Her Husband Have Two Kids,    he's on Wall Street and she
Janice: Oh My God! (Chandler and Monica are speechless).
Chandler (to Monica): Sure.
 [Scene: Joeys Apartment. Hes There And Phoebe Comes    in.]
Phoebe: Hey Joey, want come with me to are you ok?
Joey: Yeah, I Just I Just Feel Bad About Firing Estelle. This Is Got To Be    killing her.
Phoebe: No, that wouldnt kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Joey: I Dont Know. Shes Got To Be Taking It Hard, I Was Like    Her Only Client. Except For This Guy Who Eats Paper. And Im Guessing    He Eats More Money Than He Makes. Look, I Know Shes Not A Great Agent, But    she did stick with me for ten years. Im gonna call her and hire her again.
Phoebe: No, No, No! Don'T Call Her! You Wait For Her To Call    you (Joey considers it)
Joey: Why?
Phoebe: Because Patience Is The Road To Understanding (She Thinks) Which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.
Joey: (impressed) You blow me away. 
Phoebe: (Picking Up Her Bag) All Right, So Promise You'Re Gonna Wait For Her    to call you?
Joey: I Promise. And That Means, Never Having To Give A Reason. (Phoebe Stops    herself from laughing and leaves)
 [Scene: The House Monica And Chandler Are Viewing. Janice Comes    down the stairs.]
Janice: What a small world!
Chandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Realtor: You two know each other?
Janice: Oh, We Go Way Back. Before Monica Made An Honest Man    Out Of Him, Chandler Used To Be My Little Love Muffin! (Does Her Irritating    Laugh). So? Are You Guys Thinking Of Getting This House Too? Ooh! Are We Gonna    Have A Bidding War? I'D Better Warn You, I'M A Toughie (Playfully Punches Chandler,    who tries to get away from her)
Chandler: (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)
Monica: No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)
Chandler: (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
Monica: (Looks Confused And Scared) I Don'T Know    why.
Janice: Ooh, That Decides It Then. I Was On The Fence.    But Knowing That You Two Would Be Our Neighbors? Ah! Now We Have To    Get It! (Chandler And Monica Are Utterly Shocked) Ellen, We'Re Going To Talk    numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside) 
Chandler: This can not be happening!
Monica: Okay, The Realtor Said Another Couple Made An Offer.    Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Chandler: The Only Way That That Is Going To Happen, Is If The Other Couple    are the Hitlers.
Monica: (Thinks A Little More) Okay, Okay, (Clapping Her Hands)    All Right. What If We Got Both Houses? Huh? We Can Turn This House    into a guest house.
Chandler: That Is A Great Idea! And By The Way, I Don'T Mean To Sound Distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money!?
Monica: Okay, you come up with an idea.
Chandler: Alright Alright, We Still Have Three Hours Till Escrow Closes On    our house. We can still get out.
Monica: But we love our house.
Chandler: Will We Love It So Much With Her Next Door? And She'S Gonna Be Louder    out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) "Oh My God"! 

Monica: Okay, But If We Don'T Get This House, She'S Stil Gonna Show Up Wherever    We Go! I Mean, At Least If She'S Here, It Eliminates The Element Of Suprise.    I Mean, Never Again Will You Have To Hear The Three Words That Make Your Balls    Jump Back Up Inside Your Body. (She Shows This With Her Index Finger, Mimicking    it pushing something up)
Chandler: (Looks Afraid, But At The Same Time, Knows She'S Right) Well, We    Have To Do Something. We Can'T Have Her Living Next Door. (Janice'S Laughs Loudly    outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
 [Scene: Mr. Zellner'S Office. There Is A Knock On The Door.] r Zelner: Who is it?
Ross: (Enters) It'S Me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner Looks Annoyed)    Look, I Um, I Now Rachel Turned You Down But I Think There Is A Way You Might    be able to get her to come back. 
Mr Zelner: This May Surprise You, But Re-Hiring Fired Employees,    is not my main job.
Ross: Just Hear Me Out. How Would You Feel About Offering Her A Raise? (Looks    hopeful)
Mr Zelner: (obviously amused) Not good, Ron. 
Ross: Perhaps I Can Persuade You. What If You Can Give Your Son This (Takes    a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
Mr Zelner: (Takes A Long Look At The Egg While He Considers It) Wow, That'S    pretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross)
Ross: Huh? So? We have a deal?
Mr Zelner: Okay, you got it.
Ross: Yes! yes! 
Mr Zelner: This is gonna make me very popular.
Ross: Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Mr Zelner: (looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused) I meant with my son.
Ross: Good, 'Cause The Ladies, Not So Much. (Shakes His Head, Give Him A Thumbs    up and leaves)
 [Scene: Joey'S Apartment. He Walks In Reading His Mail, And Plays    back his messages on the answering machine]
Answering Machine: Joey, This Is Al T. Booker, (Looks Annoyed  That He Called Him) The Guy Who Eats Paper. I'M Sure You'Ve Heard That Estelle  Passed Away. (Looks Shocked) I Wanted To Let You Know There'S A Memorial For Her  at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it. 
Joey: Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?
Phoebe: (On The Other Side Of The Line, Still Pretending To Be Estelle) Joey,    it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
Joey: Estelle?
Phoebe: Yeah, I Wanted To Call And Tell You That There'S No Hard Feelings For    firing me.
Joey: (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Phoebe: Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
Joey: No, No, No! (Starts Looking Around The Room, Terrified) Don'T Drop By,    don't drop by!
Phoebe: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Joey: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Phoebe: (Looks Around) It'S Alright. Look Kiddo, I Gotta Go. Good Luck With    the career. You're gonna be huge.
Joey: Thanks For Everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs Up And Reads The Phone Display)    "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
 [Scene: The House Next Door To Chandler And Monica'S New House.    Chandler is pacing worriedly through the living room when Janice enters.]
Janice: Well... I Just Talked To Sid, We Are Definitely Putting In An Offer On  the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.
Chandler: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Janice: All Right, I Got To Run. Tell Monica I Say Goodbye. And... I'Ll See    you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)
Chandler: Wait! I Just Want You To Know That... I'M So Happy You'Re Going To    be here.
Janice: Oh, me too... (laughs)
Chandler: Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Janice: Huh?
Chandler: I never stopped loving you.
Janice: Oh... my...
Chandler: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! I Want You... I Need You... I Must Have You Janice    Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Janice: Chandler, what are you talking about?
Chandler: Now That You Live Next Door, We Can Be Together Every Day. Sid And    Monica never have to know a thing.
Janice: I Don'T Know What To Say... I Mean, You Know, Obviously We Have This...    heat between us.
Chandler: (stunned) Obviously.
Janice: But I Love My Husband. And I Know You Love Your Wife. Now, I Don'T    think we should get this house now.
Chandler: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Janice: Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
Chandler: I understand.
Janice: Although, Maybe Just... One Last Moment Of Weakness... (She Kisses    Chandler Flat On The Mouth. Chandler Squirms. When She'S Finished, He Looks    at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)
Chandler: (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
 [Scene: Ross'S Apartment. Ross Is Working On His Laptop When    Rachel enters with Emma.]
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Ross: What?
Rachel: Ralph Lauren Called Again And They Offered    me more money.
Ross: They did?
Rachel: Yeah. It Was The Weirdest Thing. Zelner Called Me And He Said We'Ll    Do Everything We Can To Get You Back. And That I Should Thank Some Ron... I    don't even know what department that guy's in.
Ross: So, what are you gonna do?
Rachel: Well, I took it.
Ross: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Both: YAY! WHOO! YAY!
Ross: You're excited, right?
Rachel: (Hesitant) Ye-Ah. Yeah! You Know, The Money'S Great.    It's certainly the easier choice...
Ross: Right!
Rachel: Yeah, You Know, Was I Looking Forward To Going To    Paris? Sure. You Know, Was I Excited About Working In The Fashion Capital    Of The World? Ooh, Absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, But You Know, This Is... It'S    Fine. I'M Fine Going Back To A Job Where I'Ve Pretty Much Gotten Everything Out Of    That I Possibly Can... (She Sits Down, And Ross Who Is Stunned To Hear All This    follows her example)
Ross: Uhm, I Hadn'T No You... I Had No Idea You Were So Excited About Paris.    Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Rachel: Well Yeah, But I Mean, It Was Good Scared Though, You Know? Like When    I-Moved-To-New-York Scared. Or Uhm, When I-Found-Out-I-Was-Gonna-Have-Emma Scared...    But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
Ross: (after a long pause) You should go.
Rachel: What?
Ross: It's what you want. You should go.
Rachel: You really think so?
Ross: I really do.
Rachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Ross: (Picks Up A Skull Of Some Carnivore From His Side Table And Puts It In    The Same Bag In Which He Brought The Pterodactyl Egg To Zelner) I'M Sure He'Ll    understand.
Rachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Ross: Yeah...
Rachel: Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Ross: Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)
Rachel: Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Ross: Then I'M Happy Too. (They'Re Still Hugging - Fade Out) Commercial Break [Scene: Estelle'S Memorial Service. Joey Is Giving A Speech.    Next To Him Is A Blown Op Photograph Of Estelle Behind Her Desk And There'S    a man standing next to him.]
Joey: Thank You All For Coming. We'Re Here Today To Pay Respects    To A Wonderful Agent And A Beautiful Woman... (Joey Looks At The Photograph)    ..Inside. As Estelle'S Only Two Clients We Would Like To Say A Few Words. (Joey    Looks For His Notes. The Man Next To Him Is Chewing Something.) Dude, Where'S    My Speech? (The Man Swallows Something And Looks At Joey.) That Is    Entertaining. Al Zebooker Everybody. (He Applauds And Al Shows That There'S    Nothing Left In His Mouth.) THE END
